<p>Unique to the University of California, Berkeley’s Data Science Education development has been our <a class="reference external" href="#bookmark=id.fxyvojhozv8z">DataHub Cyberinfrastructure</a> and <a class="reference external" href="#bookmark=id.7y2w6jb0vj5v">Autograding Cyberinfrastructure</a>. The campus community enables full access to data science environments through any device capable of running a web browser connected to the internet. This alleviated the burden and inequity of requiring students to upgrade their personal computing devices to a minimum standard which would have been a barrier to widespread student participation.  The autograder is an essential component of any scalable computation-centered course that includes graded assignments. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ucbds-infra/otter-grader">Otter Grader</a> is used for autograding.</p>
<p>The Data Science Undergraduate Studies program at UC Berkeley is a matrix of courses and learning opportunities for students to be directly involved in Data Science both in and outside of classrooms.  UC Berkeley’s most notable Data Science development has been the creation of the <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-major">Data Science major</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-minor">minor</a> programs that welcomes a large number of students from diverse academic and personal backgrounds.  The <a class="reference external" href="#foundations-of-data-science-course">Foundations of Data Science Course</a>, Data 8 serves as an initial access point for many students who are interested but might not have any prior experience. Students may initiate their Data Science experiences through this course or find their way to Data 8 from <a class="reference external" href="#bookmark=id.iexpon2asusa">Data Science Modules</a>, known as “Modules” that have been embedded into the curriculum of other domain area courses. The curricular experiences of students may then continue both through upper level Data Science courses and through <a class="reference external" href="#bookmark=id.zd605bma5exj">Domain Connector Courses</a>, or better known as just “Connector Courses” that integrate Data Science learning across the semester-long course.  The <a class="reference external" href="#bookmark=id.8vo5c58qy13h">Data Science Discovery Projects</a> also offers students the opportunity for applied experience with partnering organizations on a semester-long project.</p>
<p>Conscious of the differences in student experiences and backgrounds, programs continue to be developed that focus on uplifting and providing additional support to students from populations that are underrepresented in Data Science.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The [Data Scholars Program](#bookmark=id.1ux00zqf5upx) accepts a cohort of students each semester for  participation in the program components: a foundations seminar, academic development, [discovery research](https://data.berkeley.edu/research/discovery-program-home), [career accelerator](https://data.berkeley.edu/careeraccelerator), and a speaker series. The [Data Scholars Foundation Seminar](#data-scholars-foundations-seminar) is a course that provides additional structure and support as they are enrolled in the Foundations of Data Science Course.  The [Data Scholars Pathways Seminar](#bookmark=id.o7bxyb82125b) invites students to join in a series of talks from professionals in the field to learn more about career opportunities and development. The [Data Scholars Discovery Research Projects](#data-scholars-discovery-projects-seminar) partners with the existing Discovery Research Program to ensure Data Scholars are matched with appropriate research projects for a semester-long experience.

<p>The Datahub is the core infrastructure that serves live computational environments to all students for Data 8, Modules, and other Data Science courses. Students can work entirely from the DataHub running in the cloud. It is available to everyone on campus— not limited just to students enrolled in courses— accessible via the standard campus Single Sign-On (SSO) through &lt;<a class="reference external" href="https://datahub.berkeley.edu/">https://datahub.berkeley.edu/</a>&gt;. It is built entirely on open source software that runs on commercial cloud platforms and/or bare metal infrastructure managed by campus IT staff and student infrastructure teams. The 3 key open source components are JupyterHub, Kubernetes, and Docker integrated together as described in <a class="reference external" href="https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Zero to Jupyterhub with Kubernetes</a>.</p>

<section id="target-audience-target-audience">
<h2>Target Audience {#target-audience}<a class="headerlink" href="#target-audience-target-audience" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>There are 3 key target audiences at the campus-level: students, instructors, and <em>anyone</em> on campus. Initially the infrastructure was created to support the instructors teaching Data 8 to 60 students in Fall 2015, with the aim from the outset of scaling Data 8 to a much larger size (1350 students as of Spring 2020), as well as to other courses and use cases campus-wide beyond Data 8 itself. Designing for scale from the start also allowed going beyond the campus audience to a global audience with <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/news/data-8-thrives-and-campus#main-inner:~:text=Data%208%20Extends%20Beyond%20Berkeley">75,000 students enrolling in Data 8X on the edX platform</a> in Spring 2018.</p>
<p>For instructors this enabled an entirely new way of growing class sizes and reaching students at scale. This alleviated the burden of supporting and troubleshooting the differences in individual student laptops and personal devices, as well as updating software and notebooks over time. This was at the expense of instructors learning a new teaching toolset and workflows.</p>
<p>For students this enabled full access to data science environments through any device capable of running a web browser connected to the internet from any location. This alleviated the burden and inequity of requiring students to upgrade their personal computing devices to a minimum standard which would have been a barrier to widespread student participation. However this also introduced the requirement of an internet connection to be able to use the cloud infrastructure any time the student worked on class assignments, as there is no offline-mode feature available for the Datahub.</p>
<p>For anyone on campus with an interest in Data Science, the Datahub infrastructure was made available to everyone via standard campus Single Sign-On (SSO) credentials. This lowered the barrier for anyone curious to explore beyond the official course offerings without special access or permissions. Instructors could try out the platform by themselves; students could use the platform outside of class for their own projects or <a class="reference external" href="https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2019-Fall-INFO-298-002-GRP-002">directed group study</a>; researchers and scholars could experiment with how to use it in their research workflows— which spawned a Datahub variation called <a class="reference external" href="https://jupyter.org/binder">BinderHub</a> to share reproducible interactive computing environments from code repositories for other use cases such as workshops, research collaborations, and reproducible scientific analysis. The creation of Binderhub for research on publicly available clouds to anyone in the world via &lt;<a class="reference external" href="https://mybinder.org/">https://mybinder.org/</a>&gt; made it easy to share educational materials outside UC Berkeley to allow anyone at other institutions to interact with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/08/Functions_and_Tables.html">open data science textbooks</a>.</p>

<p>Autograding allows instructors to easily and efficiently grade student assignments, and also lets students have a way to check their own progress and ensure they are headed in the right direction on the way to completing an assignment. It is an essential component of any scalable computation-centered course that includes graded assignments. There are several different options for autograding, several of which were developed by faculty and students at UC Berkeley. Choosing an autograder depends on the scale and particular requirements of a particular course.</p>

<h2>Overview {#overview}<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://data8.org/">Foundations of Data Science (Data 8)</a> is an introductory data science course that combines principles and skills in statistics, programming, inference, modeling, hypothesis testing, visualization, and exploration. It provides a foundation in the many fields encompassed within data science and gives students a practical introduction to the technical field. There may be 1200-1500 students registered for Data 8 during any given semester. <a class="reference external" href="#bookmark=kix.aa37l8ay2tsy">Undergraduate Student Instructors</a> are employed to lead class discussion sections as well as grading for large classes. These students serve as peer instructors to lower-division undergraduates taking the course. The course may be taken concurrently with a <a class="reference external" href="#bookmark=id.zd605bma5exj">Domain Connector Course</a>.

</section>
<section id="id6">
<h2>Goals {#goals}<a class="headerlink" href="#id6" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>This course introduces students to programming and statistics so that they can comfortably carry out computational data science techniques. Ethical implications and biases are heavily addressed while introducing machine learning, using real-world examples in lectures, labs, and homework.</p>
<p>Linking domain knowledge to data science as students learn coding and statistics is a key goal of the course. Students receive support from upper-classmen, near-peers who have roles as <a class="reference external" href="#bookmark=kix.aa37l8ay2tsy">Undergraduate Student Instructors</a>.</p>
<p>Introducing data science without prerequisite courses in advanced mathematics, statistics, or computer science allows students to rapidly develop science capital and cultivate their science identity.</p>
<p>The Foundations Course provides a personal experience for over 1,500 students each semester.  To achieve this feat, the Foundations Course has forty-five teaching assistants (TAs), approximately six of whom are Head TAs who organize the system of teaching assistant support.</p>
<p>The instructional team collaborates to support the multitiered student experience in the course.  Academic interns are involved in supporting labs (3hrs/week), New and Returning Tutors (8hrs/week) are involved in grading, tutoring sessions, proctoring and team meetings.</p>

<p>At its core, the course lowers the level of abstraction by using domain-related questions while teaching Python coding and statistical methods. Near-peer teaching takes place by undergraduate student instructors who have taken the course before and have some level of pedagogical training. A built-in grader for immediate feedback facilitates active learning while the student is completing assignments.</p>
<p>While the Foundations Course acknowledges the broader field, this course is designed to focus only on the computation skills that students need in order to work with data. For example, the necessary prerequisites for a Computer Science Course 1 include “Read and write compound expressions that involve variables and multiple data types.”  The Foundations Course focuses on core strategies to prepare students for more complex work, such as working with methods to visualize the data with tables and arrays, as well as learning the differences between names and strings while avoiding unnecessary language syntax and semantics.</p>
<p>The goal is to write code that can do something interesting without learning about all kinds of compound expressions. The Foundations Course does teach the importance of syntax and programming languages in writing down computational simulations.</p>

<p>The Foundations Course is designed to be inclusive of all students.  Inclusion is built through the belief that all students’ lives and educational experiences can be enriched through data literacy.</p>
<p>This course—and all of the other UCB Data Science Educational Program courses—are built with open-access infrastructure and tools.</p>
<p>Jupyter Notebooks are easily accessible for students with little data or statistical knowledge. This provides students with both a low barrier to entry and the basis to develop a positive data science identity.</p>

<p><em>Foundations of Data Science</em> combines three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social issues surrounding data analysis, such as privacy and design.</p>

<p>Institutions using different course management systems may need to adjust some of the cyberinfrastructures. The digital infrastructure of the course must be set up and tested before the course begins. Setting up a Jupyterhub can vary depending on the planned course size. Additionally, having an automatic grader is essential for large class sizes.</p>
<p>Two components of the program that require additional resources for near-peer teaching are Data Peers consulting and Undergraduate Student Instructors. The creation of Connector Courses and DS Modules will also require networking and collaboration with other campus departments.</p>

<h1>Data Science Modules  {#data-science-modules}<a class="headerlink" href="#data-science-modules-data-science-modules" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<section id="id7">
<h2>Overview {#overview}<a class="headerlink" href="#id7" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Data Science Modules (“DS Modules”) are short explorations into data science that give students the opportunity to work hands-on with a data set relevant to their course and receive some instruction on the principles of data analysis, statistics, and computing. DS Modules are designed and taught in an existing course from any discipline or field with the help and collaboration of the Data Science Modules Development Team and the course instructor. These DS Modules are often presented as interactive lectures or labs that allow students to learn from data sets that pertain to their course material.</p>
<p>The target audience for DS Modules are students with little to no previous data science knowledge or experience. Providing DS Modules within existing courses and in a range of disciplines, allows students who may never sign up for a data science course on their own the opportunity to gain skills in the field of data science. Another context would be for students who do have some data science experience (e.g. having taken Data 8) to engage more deeply in domain driven exploration of data using a familiar approach.</p>
<p>The DS Modules Development Team collaborates with instructors across different departments and with a range of technical skills in order to connect with a wide variety of students. Cross-departmental connection helps to build the DS Modules program presence on campus and attract other faculty. Instructors work closely with the Development Team so that they can either teach the DS Modules themselves or assist while the DS Modules Development Team leads the class.</p>
<p>DS Modules are an excellent way for students to have a smooth and supported introduction to computing, statistics, and vital tools used in data science, which are becoming increasingly relevant across academic disciplines. They empower students to do research and pose their own questions using data, as well as enable instructors to apply new lenses to their area of expertise. By the end of a DS Module, students will learn to process data in real-time, write and execute code, make visualizations, develop analytical skills, and learn to apply these skills to their relevant field or course work.</p>
</section>
<section id="id8">
<h2>Key Pedagogical or Curricular Strategies {#key-pedagogical-or-curricular-strategies}<a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>DS Modules vary widely and are customized based on each instructor’s objectives and course content. A DS Module might simply be one or two lectures on how to interpret data and statistics in news media reports or a multiple-session research workshop for students working on a data-centered project. Students in DS Modules learn to use the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language and complete assignments in <a class="reference external" href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a>, both industry-standard data science tools used in the <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs">Data Science Undergraduate Studies</a>. Instructors use these tools to share data with students, assign homework and write instructions in the cloud-based notebook, and then ask for students’ interpretation of the results, all within the same environment.</p>
<p>As mentioned, DS Modules bring data-driven instruction into courses by providing Jupyter Notebooks, an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter Notebooks are used for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.</p>
<p>Undergraduate data science students on the Jupyter Notebook Development Team work with instructors to create the content in a set of 1 to 3 notebooks to deploy into an existing class. The instructor may be teaching about a topic extensively so that students are primed for the content. For example, if implicit bias is covered heavily in a few sections of a psychology course, implementing a DS Module allows students to collect and explore data, and analyze trends in the research field. This hands-on data analysis often includes computational or critical thinking assignments.</p>
<p><em>Implementation Steps</em></p>
<p>If an instructor would like to incorporate a DS Module into their course, the first step in the process is to hold a one-on-one meeting with the DS Modules Program Coordinator to outline the deliverables, curricular strategies, and develop a plan for collaboration between the DS Modules Development Team and the instructor, which should include a timeline for mid-term and long-term deliverables. In a subsequent planning meeting, the specific data set is discussed and the instructor’s desired outcomes are further clarified.</p>
<p>Depending on the faculty member and the graduate students supporting the course, the DS Modules Development Team may offer more or less support. Sometimes the faculty is familiar with Python and prefers deploying the Jupyter Notebook themselves. Alternatively, the DS Modules Development Team can teach the DS Modules to the class.</p>
<p>Another implementation method can include a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI). The GSI can learn how to use the Jupyter Notebook and implement it within their lab section. The Jupyter Notebooks are created with an entry-level coding approach and support documentation so that they can be straightforward for the GSIs to support within the context of the DS Module lesson. In this case, the DS Module Development Team will train the GSI and attend the first lab to support during its deployment. Then, the second time the GSI offers the class they can either instruct independently or have continued support from the DS Modules Development Team.</p>
<p>After implementing a DS Module, it is important for them to collect feedback from the instructor and the students. The Data Science Undergraduate Studies likes to have constructive discussions with instructors about what worked well, what didn’t work, and to receive ideas for improvement. They collect student feedback by sending out evaluations that ask questions about both the content and pacing.</p>
<p>One challenge is the maintenance of the Modules curricular material over time.  The Jupyter Notebooks in some cases may need to be regularly updated both for content and for technical updates. Therefore, if the Notebooks are not regularly updated, then there may be a loss of efficiency. It is important to have a regular schedule to refresh the materials and to ensure they continue to be a helpful resource.</p>
<p>_Training &amp; Outreach _</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gCxbf4_5a1CKgRtTxy1eUbHnKv9-nKG68A4moy8jATE/edit">Data Science Module Mentors</a> executes a flow of data science instruction and recruitment for the DS Modules program. It can begin with the summer workshop where the DS Modules program teaches faculty from various departments data science methods and gets them ready to adapt data science teaching tools to their own subject area. This training serves as a way to connect with faculty by working together to create new DS Modules for their courses and teaching them key preparation and implementation methods.</p>
<p>The Data Science Undergraduate Studies at Berkeley has created a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ds-modules/modules-textbook">Curriculum Guide</a><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>to help instructors with set-up, workflow, and pedagogy in teaching data sciences courses connected to Data 8. Much of the content in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ds-modules/modules-textbook">Curriculum Guide</a> is useful for instructors teaching with Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterHub deployments. In many cases an instructor who is familiar with Python and Jupyter can launch their own notebook based assignments with minimal help from the DS Modules team.</p>
<p>Program representatives speak at the <a class="reference external" href="https://ais.berkeley.edu/home">Academic Innovations Studio</a>, a campus space that supports pedagogy through the collaboration of faculty, researchers, graduate students, and staff. The organization is part of <a class="reference external" href="https://rtl.berkeley.edu/">Research, Teaching, and Learning</a>, a larger organization that also houses the<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> <a class="reference external" href="https://research-it.berkeley.edu/">Research IT</a></span> group.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/">Data Science Undergraduate Studies</a> is continuously looking for faculty interested in developing a DS Module for their course. They often give presentations to departments, groups of faculty, or hold one-on-one meetings with instructors to give them an idea of how implementing a DS Module would be beneficial for their students.</p>

<h2>Key Diversity and Inclusion Practices and Strategies {#key-diversity-and-inclusion-practices-and-strategies}<a class="headerlink" href="#id9" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The focus of conducting DS Modules is to (a) give students exposure to data science through cross-disciplinary instruction and (b) offer data science tools to students who may otherwise never have the opportunity. DS Modules have been taught to everyone from first-year students with no coding or statistics experience to seniors taking upper-division econometrics. The <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/">Data Science Undergraduate Studies</a> has developed Data Science Modules for courses in:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sociology</p></li>
<li><p>Legal Studies</p></li>
<li><p>Economics</p></li>
<li><p>Psychology</p></li>
<li><p>Information Studies</p></li>
<li><p>Medieval Studies</p></li>
<li><p>Rhetoric</p></li>
<li><p>Gender and Women’s Studies</p></li>
<li><p>Linguistics</p></li>
<li><p>Education</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/">Data Science Undergraduate Studies</a> partner with D-Lab, and often collaborate with <a class="reference external" href="https://calnerds.berkeley.edu/">Cal NERDS</a>, an organization that is “comprised of a suite of programs and initiatives that provide faculty-mentored research opportunities, specialized tech training, graduate school preparation, career coaching, community building, and professional development to high achieving STEM undergraduates and graduate students.” <a class="reference external" href="https://calnerds.berkeley.edu/">Cal NERDS</a> gain expertise, build community, and contribute to the STEM workforce.</p>
<p>The DS Modules team works with <a class="reference external" href="https://slc.berkeley.edu/summer-bridge">the Summer Bridge Program</a> to increase the diversity of UC Berkeley students working on DS Module development.  The Summer Bridge program is a six-week, academic residential program, serving 300+ entering undergraduates every summer. Scholars take a full course load, including two educational courses and a mentorship program that acclimates students to the research university. In a collaboration with the <a class="reference external" href="https://seedscholars.berkeley.edu/">SEED Scholars program</a>, DSUS has hosted a 6 week summer class for an entering cohort of underrepresented students already accepted to UC Berkeley who are planning to study in STEM majors.  The Data 6 course is a quick onramp to the programming fundamentals that students would need to succeed in classes such as Data 8 or CS 61A.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/education/data-science-education-opportunities">Data Science Undergraduate Studies</a> is working to get High School students involved in Data Science  through a summer program. <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/news/berkeley-unboxing-data-science-buds-engaging-high-schoolers-data-science-research">Berkeley Unboxing Data Science (BUDS</a>)  is a summer program that has been carried out in 2020 and 2021with a small cohort of high school students from under-represented backgrounds. The students were introduced to a range of data science techniques and examples, and talked through scenarios about the ethical and social implications of the studies.</p>
<p>Given that all UC Berkeley undergraduates have an American Cultures graduation requirement, there has been a big push to develop DS Modules within <a class="reference external" href="https://americancultures.berkeley.edu/students/courses">American Cultures</a> classes. This provides another great opportunity to expand data science approaches into topic areas that have not traditionally employed them. This collaboration has produced a portfolio of social justice DS Modules (within the American Cultures courses). In some cases, the DS Modules team reached out to AC instructors, whereas in other cases motivated instructors reached out independently to the team with a request to develop a DS Module. To begin the process, an instructor can make a straightforward request using the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12u2lyW18ifZhl2bSxWbAVqHAFP9v0iioXb86acIb3LE/viewform?edit_requested=true">form</a> on the <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/education/data-science-education-opportunities">Data Science Undergraduate Studies</a> website.</p>
<p>For example, a DS Module was developed for Ethnic Studies 21, a class  on mass incarceration, by a student who had taken the course in a previous semester. This DS Module explored prison overcrowding and realignment data. In a full cycle of its development and implementation, this studentled the DS Module in the class for its initial deployment.</p>

<section id="id10">
<h2>Overview {#overview}<a class="headerlink" href="#id10" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The Domain Connector Courses program weaves together core concepts and approaches from Data 8 with complementary ideas or areas. These courses allow students to use analytic tools from the <em><a class="reference external" href="http://data8.org/">Foundations Course</a></em> and apply them within diverse disciplinary contexts. Students will gain additional experience, broader insights, and deeper theoretical or computational foundations. Courses include a combination of data science and domain-specific material, and are developed for and with departments across campus. The Connector Courses program are 2-unit semester-long courses within a domain area.</p>
</section>
<section id="program-description-program-description">
<h2>Program Description {#program-description}<a class="headerlink" href="#program-description-program-description" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The Connector Courses bring together domain-specific instruction and outreach to faculty and instructors interested in doing the curriculum development, along with support from student developers and open-access materials, that benefit both the students and the repository of courses.</p>
<p>A key feature of the Connector Courses is the iterative process of development, and the repeated offering of the course.  The open-access curriculum guide provides those who are considering developing or taking a Connector Course with specific and accessible information.</p>
<p>The Connector Courses program has two facets:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The undergraduate data science student development along with the implementation of the curriculum by faculty and graduate students</p></li>
<li><p>The undergraduate data science student experience in applying data science</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="id11">
<h2>Target Audience {#target-audience}<a class="headerlink" href="#id11" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The Domain Connector Courses are an opportunity for students looking to explore a specific domain area (in a two-unit seminar) that is entry-level by design, specifically meant <em>not</em> to be overwhelming. These courses are intended to be taken in the same semester as the Foundations Course, although many students also take them after they have taken the Foundations Course.</p>
</section>
<section id="id12">
<h2>Goals {#goals}<a class="headerlink" href="#id12" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>A Connector Course allows students to weave together core concepts and strategies from the Foundations Course with complementary class topics. Along the way, students gain additional experience, broader insights, and deeper theoretical or computational foundations. Instructors from across campus teach Domain Connector Courses. Data 8 and Connectors complement each other and often use similar materials, tools, and course infrastructure (e.g., DataHub, Piazza, Jupyter Notebooks).</p>
</section>
<section id="id13">
<h2>Key Pedagogical or Curricular Strategies {#key-pedagogical-or-curricular-strategies}<a class="headerlink" href="#id13" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Connector Courses are based on active learning as students navigate data science methodologies in class. Active learning is a method of learning in which students are actively or experientially involved in the learning process and where there are different levels of active learning, depending on student involvement (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning#CITEREFBonwellEison1991">Bonwell &amp; Eison 1991</a>). The students are able to develop ways to evaluate trends in the data examples or those they have found pertaining to a specific field or sector.</p>
<p>Because the <a class="reference external" href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/gsis/prospective/ugsi">Undergraduate Student Instructors (UGSIs)</a> are a part of the support network, there is also a very deliberate and consistent near-peer learning model in action throughout the classes. UGSIs are students that (a) have already taken the course and received a high mark, (b) are in good academic standing, and (c) enroll in or have taken a pedagogy class. Student instructors who assist with Connector Courses are called _Connector Assistants _(CA).</p>
<p>The courses use open-source <a class="reference external" href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a> with materials stored and made accessible on GitHub.  A Connector Course’s GitHub site includes materials accessible to the students as well as private, locked materials, such as homework solutions and exam answer keys, that are only accessible to the faculty and CAs.</p>
</section>
<section id="id14">
<h2>Key Diversity and Inclusion Practices and Strategies {#key-diversity-and-inclusion-practices-and-strategies}<a class="headerlink" href="#id14" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The diverse courses allow for students across general interests to take classes together. For example, a psychology student could take a psychology-specific Connector Course and a data science student could be interested in the application in psychology.</p>
<p>As well, this program matches student developers to assist in the creation of materials for the courses. They can help brainstorm ideas and translate them into Python. The faculty work with students in close collaboration. This feedback loop allows faculty and instructors to experience the learning and development of course materials with an experienced data science developer student.</p>
<p>A second significant opportunity for both the course instructor and students is that the Data Science Undergraduate Studies (DSUS) can match up one or more undergraduates to assist with the course throughout the semester. They do not do any grading but do answer questions during lab sections, proofread notebooks, maintain the course website, develop course materials, etc. The specific tasks a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/199LIKPD8TfXwiixvQBzVxN_ViFa07eODPK_1LTg4HX8/edit">Connector Assistant (CA)</a> takes on can vary based on the instructors’ and the CA’s interests.</p>
<p>The policy is that DSUS staff will recruit and assign one CA per 30 seats in the Connector. The instructors are free to decline the help._ <em>The tasks of the CA will be to attend class and hold one office hour per week.</em> _The instructors are fully encouraged to work out alternative arrangements with their CAs that fit their needs better.</p>
<p>Connector Courses have also served to develop the cross- campus and cross- disciplinary nature of the  Data Science Undergraduate Studies (DSUS) for the campus at large. The approach and aim have been to do disciplinary outreach, exploring as many courses with faculty across departments and waiting to see which courses thrive and succeed.</p>

<p>Each replication campus will need to carefully examine and support the development of partnerships based on the interest of instructors and students.  A second consideration is how data science programs will keep these courses active after the teams create and deploy them.  There needs to be a campus-specific system for the <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/education/connectors">listing of existing course content</a>, cycles of development, and deployment.</p>
<p>All CAs are enrolled in a DATA-198, a pedagogical course that prepares student instructors through background in instructional and pedagogical concepts.</p>

<h2>Recommendations {#recommendations}<a class="headerlink" href="#recommendations-recommendations" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>There is a need for strong inter-departmental connections throughout the university. One way to address this concern is to collect data about how some inter-departmental connections work and others do not. This data would illuminate arguments for different supports, training, and follow-ups.</p>
<p>Second, graduate student research projects could be used to develop Connector Courses.  For example, there is an increased demand to include spatial data research into one or more additional Connector Courses. This research could originate from the ongoing graduate student level research projects or dissertations being developed.</p>
<p>Third, the process of outreach could be more systematic and less organic. It is important that all instructors have an equal opportunity to develop a Connector. At larger campuses, it may be difficult to spread and publicize information about this course development opportunity.</p>
<p>Fourth, faculty may need a course release to develop a robust Connector Course. It is challenging for faculty to take the time to do this development and balance other responsibilities.</p>
<p>Fifth, many excellent Connector Courses have been developed by postdocs, lecturers, librarians, and other academic staff.  These instructors may have more data science knowledge than tenured faculty and may be more motivated to develop a new course. A system to either recognize or compensate these para-academic instructors could speed up the development process.</p>

<section id="id16">
<h2>Overview {#overview}<a class="headerlink" href="#id16" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The Data Science Discovery Program connects undergraduates with hands-on, team-based opportunities to contribute to data research projects. Undergraduates collaborate with graduate and postdoctoral students, collaborative research institutions, inventive projects, and educational initiatives across UC Berkeley.  The students’ work in the Discovery Projects earns them <a class="reference external" href="https://urap.berkeley.edu/">Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program (URAP)</a> credits towards their degree. The URAP program involves Berkeley undergraduates deeply within the university’s research life through direct connection with mentors.  The undergraduate students experience first-hand what it means to be part of an intellectual community engaged in research.</p>
<p>Data science is an intrinsically interdisciplinary process with broad reach, fast-scaling capacity, and a large pool of interested students and projects. The Data Science Discovery Program, a joint effort of the <a class="reference external" href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Institute for Data Sciences</a>, Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society, and the <a class="reference external" href="http://urap.berkeley.edu/">Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program (URAP</a><span style="text-decoration:underline;">)</span>, was created in 2015.  The program was developed to offer undergraduates the opportunity to build and apply data science skills and at the same time to provide collaborators with skilled students to help address their data challenges.</p>
</section>
<section id="id17">
<h2>Target Audience {#target-audience}<a class="headerlink" href="#id17" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The Data Science Discovery Experiences model seeks to identify, connect, and scale access for undergraduate students, usually in their 3rd semester or beyond, in the data science space. It does so by creating a sustainable and diverse pipeline of projects by improving the matching and database system, fine-tuning the training and consulting services needed by graduate students, postdocs, and undergraduate research leads, and expanding internal and public communication.</p>
<p>Research Partner Organizations (both in the Berkeley community and in the broader community), faculty, and graduate students can all assist in making research accessible to students. Social Impact efforts with non-profit community groups offer the opportunity to help address critical community issues.</p>
</section>
<section id="id18">
<h2>Goals {#goals}<a class="headerlink" href="#id18" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>This program provides hands-on data science training and research experience for undergraduate students, irrespective of major while allowing students to earn academic credit in the process.</p>
<p>The discovery projects build connections via data science between campus stakeholders/units and research partnerships with community social impact organizations.</p>

<h2>Key Pedagogical or Curricular Strategies {#key-pedagogical-or-curricular-strategies}<a class="headerlink" href="#id19" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>This program uses active co-construction of cooperative learning (Chiu &amp; Linn 2011; Linn, 1995, 2000) by allowing students to work on genuine projects relevant to the “real world.” Graduate students supervise undergraduates in near-peer teaching, as students work in small groups (~5) of other students. The flexibility that arises from students being matched with projects based on their interests then enhances the opportunity for students for their professional network.</p>

<h2>Key Diversity and Inclusion Practices and Strategies {#key-diversity-and-inclusion-practices-and-strategies}<a class="headerlink" href="#id20" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society—of which the Data Science Discovery Projects program is a part—is committed to making Data Science inviting, engaging, and respectful for people of diverse identities, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. In our vision, equity and inclusion are essential elements of educating a rising generation of students, building a collaborative presence across campus, and serving society. Data Science raises fundamental issues of justice and participation in how it engages with human beings as sources of data, as analysts, and as people affected by its products. In everything the Division does, we are invested in working with our partners to shape this new field to be equitable and inclusive.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/research/discovery">Data Science Discovery Projects</a> create opportunities for students to experience sustained teamwork on projects with high potential for collaborative impact. Diverse teams of students with different backgrounds, interests, and levels of experience are supported in working together. Collaboratives explicitly foster students’ work on long-term projects oriented toward societal impact.</p>
<p>The Division’s student teams recruit from disciplines all across campus to give undergraduates opportunities to lead, form connections, and shape the Berkeley Data Science community. Teams take on projects in the curriculum, internal operations, analytics, and more. Team structure changes semester to semester based on where students see opportunities for the Division to grow. A holistic, codified application review process helps teams prioritize potential members with a passion for the field and a belief in a growth mindset over pure technical skills and experience.</p>

<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The Data Science Undergraduate Studies and D-Lab co-developed the Data Scholars Program to respond to data science education inequity.  The program exists to address under-representation issues in the data science community. Through the seminar series, it establishes a welcoming, educational, and empowering group for marginalized communities and nontraditional students. This program was launched in Fall 2016, and it is especially suited for students who bring diverse and positive contributions to data science. The program offers specialized tutoring, advising, and workshops in a sequence of three 1-unit seminar courses. Students apply to join the first seminar, Data Scholars Foundations, concurrent with the semester they enroll in the Foundations of Data Science Course and may participate in the Data Scholars Pathways seminar and Data Scholars Discovery seminar in subsequent semesters.

<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>In Pathways, students learn about the opportunities of real-world data science applications through three main avenues. First, guest speakers from industry, research, and academia talk with students on what they do with data science, how they got there, and advice for undergrads. Secondly, workshops led by the instructor, D-Lab staff, and guest speakers give students valuable professional and technical skills to secure relevant internships and research positions. Finally, self-guided exploration and reflection assignments will empower students to gain desired skills and connections in data science subfields of personal interest.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The instructor encourages a welcoming course by setting group expectations.  Examples of these expectations include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“It’s okay not to know.” This guiding principle acknowledges the acceptance and importance of questions at any time.</p></li>
<li><p>“Growth mindset.“_ _Specifically, in data science, abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work across time instead of a “fixed mindset,” assuming that you’re either good at data science or not.</p></li>
<li><p>“Everyone has something to offer in the discussion.” All of us have interacted with and been affected by “Big Data.” Everyone in the seminar brings valuable questions, opinions, and insights, regardless of their technical experience or conceptual knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>“Step up/step back.”_ _Discussion is more vibrant when you both add your unique point of view (“step-up”) AND “step back” if you’ve been sharing a lot recently (or if you’re having a bad day).</p></li>
<li><p>“Don’t yuck my yum.” No negative comments are welcome regarding someone else’s preferred workflow/tools/language/etc. (e.g., Mac vs. PC, Python vs. R, tabs vs. spaces). We will respect everyone’s preferences.</p></li>

<p>The Jupyter Notebook Development Team program assembles undergraduate student teams through an open application process. Students with a mix of data science skills, pedagogy knowledge, and a passion for a domain area are well-suited for the program. All students are part of an apprenticeship model of near-peer learning in their teams. There is a two-tier system of participation. Students begin by taking a Data 198 pedagogy course for credits and then can move on to the second tier. Students that have completed at least one semester as a team member are eligible to become a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17LS1c9qqtQIj0P_9h9oJPhkNA6StgZZ2H0GRoN8xWzo/edit">Jupyter Development Team Lead</a>.

<section id="id54">
<h2>Goals {#goals}<a class="headerlink" href="#id54" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Notebook teams develop essential course materials. Their process and production with faculty result in real-time open data science educational content.  This content provides added value to existing courses. With this added value entering the campus community, moreover, the outreach and conversations about data science and its programs at UC Berkeley increase their reach institutionally.</p>
<p>The DS Modules Program Coordinator for the UC Berkeley Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society oversees the Development Teams. Before building the DS Module, the DS Module Program Coordinator writes a contract that includes the expectations of the faculty member and the responsibilities of the development team. There are usually two types of faculty that are entering the process.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The first group of faculty are generally interested but do not know anything about data science. For these faculty, the DS Modules Program Coordinator will work with them and the team of students to find and decide on an appropriate data set and plan how this will best fit into the course they are teaching.  The development team can assist in teaching the material in the lecture, sections, or both.</p></li>
<li><p>The second group is faculty who are very familiar with data science and quickly move through the process. These faculty take on more of the planning. They decide how the DS Module can function and the deployment in the course.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the faculty signs the contract that includes the guidelines for the course, the team of students will begin to work through the development of the DS Module together.</p>

<p>Applied content in data science is made available by the work of the Jupyter Notebook Development Teams.  They work in small groups on JupyterHub to stay thoughtfully involved in the ongoing process of applied data science lessons for entry level data scientists.  Neer-peer learning allows students to move through apprenticeship level responsibilities as they move from novice (first tier) experiences into the lead of Team Lead (second tier).  The student team members create course content gaining a sense of community, collaboration skills, and professionalization imbued in a growth mindset structure as they provide difficult content into accessible chunks.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Stage 1 (Before the start of the semester): The contract is written and a meeting is held by the domain-specific DS Modules Program Coordinator, the Data Science Undergraduate Studies Curriculum Coordinator, any Graduate Student Instructors, and the faculty.</p></li>
<li><p>Stage 2 (First week of the semester): Domain-specific DS Modules Program Coordinator sends interest forms to the developers.</p></li>
<li><p>Stage 3 (Middle of the semester): The domain-specific DS Modules Program Coordinator connects the faculty and student team members over email. This email includes guidelines regarding the minimum necessary requirements of collaboration for the Jupyter Notebook development. The faculty is made aware that they should expect an email weekly, be prepared to review the first version, and review the final Jupyter Notebook.</p></li>
<li><p>Stage 4: The Team Lead becomes the coordinator of communication with the development team and the faculty.  The Team Lead also stays in close contact with the domain-specific DS Modules Program Coordinator.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the Development Team Lead does not receive a response to an initial and a follow-up reminder email, they will contact the Program Coordinator.  The Program Coordinator will then reach out.</p></li>
<li><p>The faculty needs the capacity to be able to answer questions about the set deployment date of the domain-specific DS Module weeks in advance as the Jupyter Notebook is developed.  Timely feedback and requests for changes need to be sent early so that students have the time in their course and schoolwork schedule to make the updates.</p></li>

<h2>Additional Guidance for Implementation {#additional-guidance-for-implementation}<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-guidance-for-implementation-additional-guidance-for-implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>A critical factor in moving this program from university to university is the infrastructure. UC Berkeley builds a data science program that uses existing campus resources, a specific group of staff, and agreed-upon guidelines.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>There is an assumption that all students have access to a laptop or Chrome book because the library has a lending program.</p></li>
<li><p>The program currently uses the previously existing Data Hub.</p></li>
<li><p>UC Berkeley’s program has an instructional designer with some data science teaching experience. Having someone who devotes their full time and has a knowledge of teaching foundational data science is a crucial component of the Jupyter Notebook Development Teams.  Many of the faculty would like to add data science content into their courses through DS Modules and work with the development teams but do not know how to begin.  Having staff with this experience provides someone with background work in seeking and preparing an appropriate data set and assisting in the translation of the learning experience for the Development Team.</p></li>
<li><p>UC Berkeley’s program has specific foundational criteria for their data sets.  It must be appropriate content licensed for their use and that students can work efficiently.  Again, if the faculty does not have a background in data science, this might be an impossible feat independently.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommendations {#recommendations}<a class="headerlink" href="#id58" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Finally, one idea for the program that is not yet deployed is the creation and repetition of DS Module development using templates. A set of DS Module templates would include domain agnostic templates for linear regression, cleaning data, hypothesis testing, and other familiar topics. The Jupyter Notebook Development Teams would build specific DS Modules using the models. They may be more formulaic than the current process at UC Berkeley, but it could make the management of DS Module development simpler.</p>

<section id="id59">
<h2>Overview {#overview}<a class="headerlink" href="#id59" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Data Peer Consulting is a program that supports data science work across campus. The Data Peer Consultants offer meetings with students, post-docs, visiting scholars, and faculty regarding any questions about a data science project. Currently, they primarily serve undergraduate students. There is also a smaller population of Master’s-level and Ph.D. students using their service. They also assist students from undergraduate and graduate-level courses that include a DS Module.</p>
<p>Data Peer Consulting is a program available to the campus population throughout the academic year with an online calendar that displays both the scheduled drop-in times and the peer consultant, along with the designated location on the third floor of the undergraduate library or the online meeting Zoom Link. This project began in Fall 2017 as a collaboration between the <a class="reference external" href="http://stories.lib.berkeley.edu/ccl/">Center for Connected Learning (the learning floor of spaces in the student library to support varying sensory needs and forms of hands-on learning)</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://dlab.berkeley.edu/">D-Lab</a>, and the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society. Currently, a total of sixteen students are involved in the program. Two of these students serve as <em><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fu4wSEmnS8KQQmgMoWI2zmJl-6sVOExi_IX9mGqHYsc/edit">Data Peer Consulting Leads</a></em> who oversee student meetings and communication. The team lead directly connects with both the program analyst for the UC Berkeley Data Science Undergraduate Studies and the program coordinator as they supervise their peers. All consultants work three hours a week in pairs.</p>
<p>The physical Data Peer Counseling station is set up in the library corner as a table with two individuals within a roped-off area that is perpendicular to the Data Science Peer Advising table. They have clear signage and laptops with them. This resource offers face-to-face meetings between 11am to 4pm Monday through Friday during the academic year. Students can also contact them through their program email to ask about scheduling other appointment times. A consultation typically lasts from fifteen to thirty minutes. Hour-long consultation may occur but is not typical.</p>

<h2>Target Audience {#target-audience}<a class="headerlink" href="#id60" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Because the Data Peer Consulting is physically located in a public library space, it can reach the broader campus community of students. The sixteen data peers are undergraduate students that list their coursework online so that other undergraduate students can best match their needs to the data peer. Two Data Peers commented that their primary audience is students who are not majoring in data science. The Data Peer Consulting program aims to support students from a wide range of domains who have data science questions.</p>

<h2>Goals {#goals}<a class="headerlink" href="#id61" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Overall, the primary goal of Data Peers is to support students’ data science work across campus. Data Peers is a drop-in support network for undergraduate, graduate, and faculty using data sciences in their research. This program allows for further assistance in data science for students from diverse domains who may be using data science in their coursework but do not yet understand the methodological framework.</p>
<p>This program offers a pathway to leadership in data science consultation. Students begin with specific coursework, then have the opportunity to work closely with the campus community. Students have hands-on experience that can build students’ resumes, offer course credit, and then a paid position through increased leadership.</p>

<h2>Pedagogical and Curricular Strategies {#pedagogical-and-curricular-strategies}<a class="headerlink" href="#pedagogical-and-curricular-strategies-pedagogical-and-curricular-strategies" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The conceptual framework for this program includes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Near Peer Learning</p></li>
<li><p>Self-directed learning</p></li>
<li><p>Crossover learning (the library as an informal space),</p></li>
<li><p>Distributed Learning Environments (practice across time and physical areas, see Roediger III &amp; Pyc, 2012)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As part of their training, the Data Peer student consultants all enroll in a pedagogical course, DATA-198 (a curriculum developed from combining multiple student-led DeCal courses that the students offered simultaneously covering similar material), that the DS Modules Program Coordinator taught or has been co-taught by members of Peer Consultants, Human Context and Ethics and the Modules Teams. The students are instructed broadly on education including the importance of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and a specific session on critical education. Students gain hands-on work experience in the consultations.</p>
<p>There are two components to this course: the workshop and the application.  Workshops aim to be thought-provoking and relevant.  Students assess the value of workshop content afterward to improve future iterations. It is planned to be 7 to 8 weeks of curriculum. The course has a standard pedagogy focusing on learning outcomes for instructional and consulting support. The course supports learning the workflow for consulting, lectures and instructional design.  As well, students learn how to use Git for effective collaboration on content development.  The work is data science-specific including tips and tricks for Jupyter Notebooks, recommended Python libraries, and content on ethics. Discussions include challenges and opportunities in having open-ended conversations about data and how students can respond to them during consultations.</p>
<p>The program uses a Slack Channel to communicate about common questions when they need assistance from other Data Peers. The students participate as part of the course the first year and receive pay for subsequent semesters.</p>

<p>As part of the Data 198 course, students learn about how psychological experiences can impact education and learning.  For example, the course discusses stereotype threat (Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995), imposter syndrome (Clance &amp; Imes, 1978), and how the tone of a learning environment (Jackson, 2008) impacts students. Many students express their desire to become involved because they want to join the existing community space of the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society.</p>

<h2>Program Description {#program-description}<a class="headerlink" href="#id64" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The Data Peer Consulting program provides students and faculty across campus assistance with data science work through a drop-in table at the undergraduate student library. Data Peers all take a foundational course that transitions them into developing consultation and teaching skills. During the course session, they work as a data consultant and are eligible to receive compensation in subsequent semesters.  All of the consultants connect through a Slack channel where they can share questions and answers about consultation sessions.</p>
<p>Individuals can also request a time outside of the drop-in sessions for a consultation.  Consultations generally last from fifteen minutes to one hour. This service does not cover material of substantial depth but assists in getting people “unstuck” in their data science work. Data Peer Consulting is one of the many opportunities in data science programming at UC Berkeley where students can gain hands-on skills using and trouble-shooting data science issues on campus. They had around 200 help requests in the 2020-2021 academic year.</p>

<h2>Best Practices for Variation Across Institutions {#best-practices-for-variation-across-institutions}<a class="headerlink" href="#id65" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Other institutions need to think critically about how to train the data peers (the use of DATA-198 materials). They can ensure the compatibility of the training material content by updating them to fit their student audience best.</p>
<p>Other institutions should be aware of the specific gaps that this program can fill for their institution. Building a working relationship with departments, data science courses, and faculty is important. Relationships with faculty allow for a smoother connection as the institution uses the program as a broad resource. The Data Peers program has also created a space for relationships between Data Science Undergraduate Studies and the Library, along with partners in the D-Lab and Research IT.</p>

<section id="id67">
<h2>Overview {#overview}<a class="headerlink" href="#id67" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Undergraduate Student Instructors (UGSIs) provide teaching services to support UC Berkeley’s rapidly growing data science program. Working alongside instructors, UGSIs are part of the scalable peer instruction model of the undergraduate curriculum. The UGSIs help facilitate collaborative team-based learning, near-peer instruction, and active learning. UGSIs are highly-motivated to learn and to share their knowledge. This model is a cost-effective resource that supports peer-learning, provides mentoring, and iteratively enables the co-creation of course materials alongside the professor.</p>
<p>Employing undergraduate students as instructors is a unique and successful aspect of the program, and has helped the expansion of the Data Science Undergraduate Studies over the past five years. On occasion, departments within the College of Letters &amp; Science may have a shortage of applicants for Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) positions. If no qualified graduate student from the appointing department or other departments is available, a highly motivated and advanced undergraduate may work in the GSI position. In this program, UGSIs must have previous knowledge of the subject and complete domain-specific courses on teaching Data Science.</p>
</section>
<section id="id68">
<h2>Target Audience {#target-audience}<a class="headerlink" href="#id68" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The target audience for the UGSI positions are undergraduate students who have taken and excelled at the course for which they apply. This includes students interested in skill development, leadership, and education. In general, students are seldom able or allowed to become UGIs until their second year at Cal. They often stay multiple semesters and may choose to continue teaching a particular course with a specific instructor.</p>
<p>Students may become a UGSI for one of two main reasons, reflecting the two different types of employment available with the UGSI position.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Undergraduates in the 8-hour position are often in direct contact with students because their work responsibilities include teaching student discussion sections directly, holding communal office hours, answering questions on Piazza, and prepping for their classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Undergraduates in the 20-hour position may take on specialized leadership or logistical roles, including “Head TA” and “Head of Logistics.” These UGSIs are offered fee remission, and for this reason, attract more students who are from out of state and/or interested in staying for multiple semesters.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Both UGSIs and instructors hold office hours. Moreover, there are different types of study sessions such as “Homework Parties” and “Midterm Reviews” that are run nearly entirely by student staff. Student staff often prepare study aids for the students for these sessions, such as worksheets and review sheets of practice problems for students to work on. Additionally, there are “Tutors,” another category of undergraduate student course support who help out at office hours or study sessions and are not paid. Students who begin as Tutors and perform well for a semester or more have a better chance of obtaining the UGSI job. There are a similarly large number of Tutors as there are UGSIs.</p>
</section>
<section id="id69">
<h2>Goals {#goals}<a class="headerlink" href="#id69" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Undergraduate student instructors provide a more personalized and refreshing experience for the students in data science courses. UGSIs are able to relate and provide both professional and personal support to students, often in a different way than GSIs and professors. First, UGSIs have current knowledge of the course requirements and expectations and are fully familiar with the course from a dual perspective of both a student and teacher. Second, UGSIs can share the methods they have already developed and honed to work through the course material. Third, UGSIs remember their experience with the material for the first time and are able to guide other students through the course, easily identifying roadblocks to learning material as well as providing explanations helpful to a student encountering the course for the first time. Fourth, some students feel less intimidated and more comfortable asking for help from a peer instructor rather than from a GSI or professor.</p>
<p>Becoming a UGSI is a path available to students who wish to pursue a career in education or academia.</p>

<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Notable key instructional support resources include Piazza for discussion sections  and Gradescope for grading at scale across many graders. When the course was designed the autograder OkPy is used. OkPy requires an assignment to be completed on datahub, then the data hub submits to OkPy and can be viewed in submission format, and there is a script to take the submission on Ok Py and export it to Gradescope. The course is currently using another autograding system called Otter-Grader, that is run via Gradescope.  Data 8, as well as other  courses in the data science area have an online textbook that is kept up to date, which is useful for linking chapters in slideshows. Data 100 has a separate datahub through which students can fetch and submit their assignments, which includes all the packages and dependencies so all students are working under the same environment.  

Coursework involves both coding and written components. These usually entail creating a visualization and interpreting it. Subsequently OkPy autogrades the coding and Gradescope grades the written portion.

<p>Undergraduate GSIs</p>
<p>Generally, undergraduate students may not be appointed as GSRs or GSIs, but they can be appointed as Readers or Tutors and are not eligible for the fee remission program (please refer to Article 11 of the UC-UAW contract). However, if a department is unable to recruit any qualified graduate students or hire a lecturer to fill an essential GSI position, the department may submit a written request of exception to the Graduate Division. In such cases exceptions are allowed for undergraduate GSI appointees but under NO circumstances can undergraduate students be appointed as GSRs.</p>
<p>The Dean of the Graduate Division has delegated authority to the deans of the College of Letters and Science and the College of Engineering to approve undergraduate GSIs.</p>
<p>If the department or hiring unit is not in College of Letters &amp; Science or College of Engineering, please complete the Request to Appoint Undergraduates as GSIs Form (XLS) and provide an explanation of why undergraduates must be hired to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:gradappt&#37;&#52;&#48;berkeley&#46;edu">gradappt<span>&#64;</span>berkeley<span>&#46;</span>edu</a>.</p>
<p>Requirements for Undergraduate GSIs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Registered in the semester in which they are teaching and remain registered through the end of the semester.</p></li>
<li><p>Enrolled in no fewer than 15 units of course work.</p></li>
<li><p>Summer Sessions UGSIs must be continuing students. (A continuing student during the summer was enrolled in the Spring semester and is enrolled for the Fall semester).</p></li>
<li><p>If the Summer Sessions UGSI is graduating with his/her terminal degree in August, they may use UGSI during that summer prior to their Summer graduation. (Please refer to the Office of the Registrar’s section on Diplomas and Graduation).</p></li>
<li><p>Upper Division status when undergraduate begins teaching.</p></li>
<li><p>Overall GPA of 3.0 or higher.</p></li>
<li><p>Previously taken the course for which an undergraduate is being appointed, its equivalent or a more advanced course, with a grade of A-or better. (If it is a course equivalent or more advanced course, please point that out on the form when submitting the request.)</p></li>
<li><p>Adhere to the same criteria of eligibility required for graduate student GSIs. If the undergraduate appointee does not speak English as a native language, they must pass the English Proficiency requirement before they can teach (please refer to the GSI Teaching &amp; Resource Center for more information). Departments/hiring units are responsible for making sure the student has passed the English Proficiency requirements prior to requesting approval for the UGSI appointment. Please contact <a class="reference external" href="mailto:langpro&#37;&#52;&#48;berkeley&#46;edu">langpro<span>&#64;</span>berkeley<span>&#46;</span>edu</a> with questions about a student’s English language proficiency eligibility.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If serving as a first-time GSI, departments/hiring units are responsible for ensuring that the UGSI fulfills the following requirements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Attend the New ASE Orientation.</p></li>
<li><p>Attend the Teaching Conference for first-time GSIs.</p></li>
