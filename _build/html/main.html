<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Data Science Modules (“DS Modules”) are short explorations into data
science that give students the opportunity to work hands-on with a data
set relevant to their course and receive some instruction on the
principles of data analysis, statistics, and computing. DS Modules are
designed and taught in an existing course from any discipline or field
with the help and collaboration of the Data Science Modules Development
Team and the course instructor. These DS Modules are often presented as
interactive lectures or labs that allow students to learn from data sets
that pertain to their course material.</p>
<p>The target audience for DS Modules are students with little to no
previous data science knowledge or experience. Providing DS Modules
within existing courses and in a range of disciplines, allows students
who may never sign up for a data science course on their own the
opportunity to gain skills in the field of data science.</p>
<p>The DS Modules Development Team collaborates with instructors across
different departments and with a range of technical skills in order to
connect with a wide variety of students. Cross-departmental connection
helps to build the DS Modules program presence on campus and attract
other faculty. Instructors work closely with the Development Team so
that they can either teach the DS Modules themselves or assist while the
DS Modules Development Team leads the class.</p>
<p>DS Modules are an excellent way for students to have a smooth and
supported introduction to computing, statistics, and vital tools used in
data science, which are becoming increasingly relevant across academic
disciplines. They empower students to do research and pose their own
questions using data, as well as enable instructors to apply new lenses
to their area of expertise. By the end of a DS Module, students will
learn to process data in real-time, write and execute code, make
visualizations, develop analytical skills, and learn to apply these
skills to their relevant field or course work.</p>
<p>Key Pedagogical or Curricular Strategies</p>
<p>DS Modules vary widely and are customized based on each instructor’s
objectives and course content. A DS Module might simply be one or two
lectures on how to interpret data and statistics in news media reports
or a multiple-session research workshop for students working on a
data-centered project. Students in DS Modules learn to use the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/">[Python]{.underline}</a> programming language and
complete assignments in <a class="reference external" href="http://jupyter.org/">[Jupyter
Notebooks]{.underline}</a>, both gold-standard data
science tools used in the <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs">[Data Science Undergraduate
Studies]{.underline}</a>.
Instructors use these tools to share data with students, assign homework
and write instructions in the cloud-based notebook, and then ask for
students’ interpretation of the results, all within the same
environment.</p>
<p>As mentioned, DS Modules bring data-driven instruction into courses by
providing Jupyter Notebooks, an open-source web application that allows
you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations,
visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter Notebooks are used for data
cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling,
data visualization, machine learning, and much more.</p>
<p>Undergraduate data science students on the Jupyter Notebook Development
Team work with instructors to create the content in a set of 1 to 3
notebooks to deploy into an existing class. The instructor may already
be teaching about a topic extensively so that students are primed for
the content. For example, if implicit bias is covered heavily in a few
sections of a psychology course, implementing a DS Module allows
students to collect and explore data, and analyze trends in the research
field. This hands-on data analysis often includes computational or
critical thinking assignments.</p>
<p><em>Implementation Steps</em></p>
<p>If an instructor would like to incorporate a DS Module into their
course, the first step in the process is to hold a one-on-one meeting
with a DS Modules Development Team member to outline the deliverables,
curricular strategies, and develop a plan for collaboration between the
DS Modules Development Team and the instructor, which should include a
timeline for mid-term and long-term deliverables. In a subsequent
planning meeting, the specific data set is discussed and the
instructor’s desired outcomes are further clarified.</p>
<p>Depending on the faculty member and the graduate students supporting the
course, the DS Modules Development Team may offer more or less support.
Sometimes the faculty is familiar with Python and prefers deploying the
Jupyter Notebook themselves. Alternatively, the DS Modules Development
Team can teach the DS Modules to the class.</p>
<p>Another implementation method can include a Graduate Student Instructor
(GSI). The GSI can learn how to use the Jupyter Notebook and implement
it within their lab section. The Jupyter Notebooks are created with an
entry-level coding approach and support documentation so that they can
be straightforward for the GSIs to support within the context of the DS
Module lesson. In this case, the DS Module Development Team will train
the GSI and attend the first lab to support during its deployment. Then,
the second time the GSI offers the class they can either instruct
independently or have continued support from the DS Modules Development
Team.</p>
<p>After implementing a DS Module, it is important for them to collect
feedback from the instructor and the students. The Data Science
Undergraduate Studies likes to have constructive discussions with
instructors about what worked well, what didn’t work, and to receive
ideas for improvement. They collect student feedback by sending out
evaluations that ask questions about both the content and pacing.</p>
<p>Faculty have had a difficult time following-up over time for further
discussions and continued iterative development, implementation, and
ongoing use of the Jupyter Notebook. The Jupyter Notebooks need to be
regularly updated both for content and for technical updates. Therefore,
if the Notebooks are not regularly updated, then there is a loss of
efficiency. It is important to have a regular schedule to refresh the
materials and to ensure they continue to be a helpful resource.</p>
<p>*Training &amp; Outreach *</p>
<p>The DS Modules Program Coordinator executes a flow of data science
instruction and recruitment for the DS Modules program. It can begin
with the summer workshop where the DS Modules program teaches faculty
from various departments data science methods and gets them ready to
adapt data science teaching tools to their own subject area. This
training serves as a way to connect with faculty by working together to
create new DS Modules for their courses and teaching them key
preparation and implementation methods.</p>
<p>The Data Science Undergraduate Studies at Berkeley has created a
[<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ds-modules/modules-textbook">Curriculum
Guide</a>]{.underline} to
help instructors with set-up, workflow, and pedagogy in teaching data
sciences courses connected to Data 8. Much of the content in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ds-modules/modules-textbook">[Curriculum
Guide]{.underline}</a> is
useful for instructors teaching with Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterHub
deployments.</p>
<p>Program representatives speak at the <a class="reference external" href="https://ais.berkeley.edu/home">[Academic Innovations
Studio]{.underline}</a>, a campus space that
supports pedagogy through the collaboration of faculty, researchers,
graduate students, and staff. The organization is part of <a class="reference external" href="https://rtl.berkeley.edu/">[Research,
Teaching, and Learning]{.underline}</a>, a
larger organization that also houses the [<a class="reference external" href="https://research-it.berkeley.edu/"> Research
IT</a>]{.underline} group.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/">Data Science Undergraduate Studies</a> is
continuously looking for faculty interested in developing a DS Module
for their course. They often give presentations to departments, groups
of faculty, or hold one-on-one meetings with instructors to give them an
idea of how implementing a DS Module would be beneficial for their
students.</p>
<p>In terms of recruiting students for the DS Module teams, sometimes it is
not difficult finding students who want to be involved in the DS Module
development teams, and in others, additional outreach is needed.</p>
<p>Key Diversity and Inclusion Practices and Strategies</p>
<p>The focus of conducting DS Modules is to (a) give students exposure to
data science through cross-disciplinary instruction and (b) offer data
science tools to students who may otherwise never have the opportunity.
DS Modules have been taught to everyone from first-year students with no
coding or statistics experience to seniors taking upper-division
econometrics. The <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/">[Data Science Undergraduate
Studies]{.underline}</a> has developed Data
Science Modules for courses in:</p>

<li><p>Sociology</p></li>
<li><p>Legal Studies</p></li>
<li><p>Economics</p></li>

</ul>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/">[Data Science Undergraduate
Studies]{.underline}</a> partner with D-Lab,
and often collaborate with <a class="reference external" href="https://calnerds.berkeley.edu/">[Cal
NERDS]{.underline}</a>, an organization
that is “comprised of a suite of programs and initiatives that provide
faculty-mentored research opportunities, specialized tech training,
graduate school preparation, career coaching, community building, and
professional development to high achieving STEM undergraduates and
graduate students.” [<a class="reference external" href="https://calnerds.berkeley.edu/">Cal
NERDS</a>]{.underline} gain expertise,
build community, and contribute to the STEM workforce.</p>
<p>The DS Modules team works with <a class="reference external" href="https://slc.berkeley.edu/summer-bridge">[the Summer Bridge
Program]{.underline}</a> to
increase the diversity of UC Berkeley students working on DS Module
development. The Summer Bridge program is a six-week, academic
residential program, serving 300+ entering undergraduates every summer.
Scholars take a full course load, including two educational courses and
a mentorship program that acclimates students to the research
university.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/education/data-science-education-opportunities">[Data Science Undergraduate
Studies]{.underline}</a>
is working to get High School students involved through a summer
program. This program is currently being developed by ______.</p>
<p>Given that all UC Berkeley undergraduates have an American Cultures
graduation requirement, there has been a big push to develop DS Modules
within <a class="reference external" href="https://americancultures.berkeley.edu/students/courses">[American
Cultures]{.underline}</a>
classes. This provides another great opportunity to expand data science
approaches into topic areas that have not traditionally employed them.
This collaboration has produced a portfolio of social justice DS Modules
(within the American Cultures courses). In some cases, the DS Modules
team reached out to AC instructors, whereas in other cases motivated
instructors reached out independently to the team with a request to
develop a DS Module. To begin the process, an instructor can make a
straightforward request using the
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12u2lyW18ifZhl2bSxWbAVqHAFP9v0iioXb86acIb3LE/viewform?edit_requested=true">form</a>
on the <a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/education/data-science-education-opportunities">Data Science Undergraduate
Studies</a>
website.</p>
<p>For example, a DS Module was developed for Ethnic Studies 21, a class on
mass incarceration, by a student who had taken the course in a previous
semester. This DS Module explored prison overcrowding and realignment
data. In a full cycle of its development and implementation, this
studentled the DS Module in the class for its initial deployment.</p>

<p>Domain Connector Courses</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>The Domain Connector Courses program weaves together core concepts and
approaches from Data 8 with complementary ideas or areas. These courses
allow students to use analytic tools from the <em>Foundations Course</em> and
apply them within diverse disciplinary contexts. Students will gain
additional experience, broader insights, and deeper theoretical or
computational foundations. Courses include a combination of data science
and domain-specific material, and are developed for and with departments
across campus. The Connector Courses program are semester-long courses
within a domain area, while the Data Science Modules are shorter lessons
within an existing course.</p>
<p>Program Description</p>
<p>The Connector Courses bring together domain-specific instruction and
outreach to faculty and instructors interested in doing the curriculum
development, along with support from student developers and open-access
materials, that benefit both the students and the repository of courses.</p>
<p>A key feature of the Connector Courses is the iterative process of
development, and the repeated offering of the course. The open-access
curriculum guide provides those who are considering developing or taking
a Connector Course with specific and accessible information.</p>
<p>The Connector Courses program has two facets:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The undergraduate data science student development along with the</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>implementation of the curriculum by faculty and graduate students</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>The undergraduate data science student experience in applying data</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>science</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Target Audience</p>
<p>The Domain Connector Courses are an opportunity for students looking to
explore a specific domain area (in a two-unit seminar) that is
entry-level by design, specifically meant <em>not</em> to be overwhelming.
These courses are intended to be taken in the same semester as the
Foundations Course, although many students also take them after they
have taken the Foundations Course.</p>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>A Connector Course allows students to weave together core concepts and
strategies from the Foundations Course with complementary class topics.
Along the way, students gain additional experience, broader insights,
and deeper theoretical or computational foundations. Instructors from
across campus teach Domain Connector Courses. Data 8 and Connectors
complement each other and often use similar materials, tools, and course
infrastructure (e.g., DataHub, Piazza, Jupyter Notebooks).</p>
<p>Key Pedagogical or Curricular Strategies</p>
<p>Connector Courses are based on active learning as students navigate data
science methodologies in class. Active learning is a method of learning
in which students are actively or experientially involved in the
learning process and where there are different levels of active
learning, depending on student involvement (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning#CITEREFBonwellEison1991">Bonwell &amp; Eison
1991</a>).
The students are able to develop ways to evaluate trends in the data
examples or those they have found pertaining to a specific field or
sector.</p>
<p>Because the <a class="reference external" href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/gsis/prospective/ugsi">[Undergraduate Student Instructors
(UGSIs)]{.underline}</a>
are a part of the support network, there is also a very deliberate and
consistent near-peer learning model in action throughout the classes.
UGSIs are students that (a) have already taken the course and received a
high mark, (b) are in good academic standing, and (c) enroll in or have
taken a pedagogy class. Student instructors who assist with Connector
Courses are called <em>Connector Assistants</em> (CA).</p>
<p>The courses use open-source <a class="reference external" href="https://jupyter.org/">[Jupyter
Notebooks]{.underline}</a> with materials stored and
made accessible on GitHub. A Connector Course’s GitHub site includes
materials accessible to the students as well as private, locked
materials, such as homework solutions and exam answer keys, that are
only accessible to the faculty and CAs.</p>
<p>Key Diversity and Inclusion Practices and Strategies</p>
<p>The diverse courses allow for students across general interests to take
classes together. For example, a psychology student could take a
psychology-specific Connector Course and a data science student could be
interested in the application in psychology.</p>
<p>As well, this program matches student developers to assist in the
creation of materials for the courses. They can help brainstorm ideas
and translate them into Python. The faculty work with students in close
collaboration. Students can receive payment for this work in the summer
to early semester weeks. This feedback loop allows faculty and
instructors to experience the learning and development of course
materials with an experienced data science developer student.</p>
<p>A second significant opportunity for both the course instructor and
students is that the Data Science Undergraduate Studies (DSEP) can match
up one or more undergraduates to assist with the course throughout the
semester. They do not do any grading but do answer questions during lab
sections, proofread notebooks, maintain the course website, develop
course materials, etc. The specific tasks a Course Assistant (CA) takes
on can vary based on the instructors’ and the CA’s interests.</p>
<p>Domain Connector Courses serve as the developers of the Data Science
Undergraduate Studies (DSEP) for the campus at large. The approach and
aim have been to do as much outreach as possible, exploring as many
courses with faculty across departments and waiting to see which courses
thrive and succeed.</p>
<p>The policy is that DSEP staff will recruit and assign one CAper 30 seats
in the Connector. The instructors are free to decline the help. The
tasks of the CA will be to attend class and hold one office hour per
week. The instructors are fully encouraged to work out alternative
arrangements with their CAs that fit their needs better.</p>

<p>The non-public documents are in private repositories for some of the
connector courses. The faculty make them restricted to store the answer
keys, etc. Therefore, there can be two repositories for each class. One
is available to everyone and one is kept private for instructors.</p>

<p>Best Practices for Variation Across Institutions</p>
<p>Each replication campus will need to carefully examine and support the
development of partnerships based on the interest of instructors and
students. A second consideration is how data science programs will keep
these courses active after the teams create and deploy them. There needs
to be a campus-specific system for the listing of existing course
content, cycles of development, and deployment. All CAs are enrolled in
a two-unit DeCal course, <em>Teaching Data Science - Connectors</em>. This
DeCal provides them with the training needed to assist with the
Connector courses. The DeCal consists of 90 hours of work for the
semester, 39 hours of which will be spent on training and outside work
for the DeCal course. The remaining 51 hours will be spent on any work
related to the Connector Course. Here is how we have broken down these
51 hours:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>9 hours of meetings with the Connector instructor</p></li>
<li><p>15 weeks x 2 hours weekly = 30 hours of Connector course labs</p></li>
<li><p>15 weeks x 1 hour weekly = 15 hours of office hours or lab prep</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other Implementation Notes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At UC Berkeley, there is an early summer workshop for instructors</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>and then biweekly meetings for Connector instructors. The workshop
and meetings cover Piazza for instructors, a teaching guide for
first-time Domain Connector Course instructors, and allow for the
creation of a cohort of people who are now more familiar with one
another each year.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Some of these courses have been developed and can replace other</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>required courses for students in specific departments. Examples
include:</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Computer Science 88 can be taken instead of Computer Science 61A</p></li>
<li><p>Statistics 89 can be taken instead of Math 54</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendations</p>
<p>There is a need for strong inter-departmental connections throughout the
university. One way to address this concern is to collect data about how
some inter-departmental connections work and others do not. This data
would illuminate arguments for different supports, training, and
follow-ups.</p>
<p>Second, graduate student research projects could be used to develop
Connector Courses. There is a need for faculty or graduate students to
include spatial data into one or more additional Connector Courses.</p>
<p>Third, the process of outreach could be more systematic and less
organic. It is important that all instructors have an equal opportunity
to develop a Connector. At larger campuses, it may be difficult to
spread and publicize information about this course development
opportunity.</p>
<p>Fourth, faculty may need a course release to develop a robust Connector
Course. It is challenging for faculty to take the time to do this
development and balance other responsibilities.</p>
<p>Fifth, many excellent Connector Courses have been developed by postdocs,
lecturers, librarians, and other academic staff. These instructors may
have more data science knowledge than tenured faculty and may be more
motivated to develop a new course. A system to either recognize or
compensate these para-academic instructors could speed up the
development process.</p>
<p>What is the process for becoming a Connector instructor?</p>
<p>What are the criteria to accept a new course or not?</p>
<p>Jupyter Notebook Development Team</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>The Jupyter Notebook Development Teams allow undergraduate students to
apply what they learn in data science courses in the production of
teaching resources. Each team has a student Team Lead who is an
experienced Jupyter Notebook developer. The teams collaborate with
instructors from across campus to build and deploy the Jupyter Notebook
in Applied Instructional Modules. Instructors teach DS Modules in one or
multiple sessions of a course.</p>
<p>Target Audience</p>
<p>The Jupyter Notebook Development Team program assembles undergraduate
student teams through an open application process. Students with a mix
of data science skills, pedagogy knowledge, and a passion for a domain
area are well-suited for the program. All students are part of an
apprenticeship model of near-peer learning in their teams. There is a
two-tier system of participation. Students begin by volunteering or
working for credits and then can move on to the second tier. Students
that have completed at least one semester as a team member are eligible
to become a Jupyter Development Team Lead. These students receive pay
for overseeing the development of the Jupyter Notebook with their team.</p>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>Notebook teams develop essential course materials. Their process and
production with faculty result in real-time open data science
educational content. This content provides added value to existing
courses. With this added value entering the campus community, moreover,
the outreach and conversations about data science and its programs at UC
Berkeley increase their reach institutionally.</p>
<p>The DS Modules Program Coordinator for the UC Berkeley Division of
Computing, Data Science, and Society oversees the Development Teams.
Before building the DS Module, the DS Module Program Coordinator writes
a contract that includes the expectations of the faculty member and the
responsibilities of the development team. There are usually two types of
faculty that are entering the process.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first group of faculty are generally interested but do not know</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>anything about data science. For these faculty, the DS Modules
Program Coordinator will work with them and the team of students
to find and decide on an appropriate data set and plan how this
will best fit into the course they are teaching. The development
team can assist in teaching the material in the lecture, sections,
or both.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>The second group is faculty who are very familiar with data science</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>and quickly move through the process. These faculty take on more
of the planning. They decide how the DS Module can function and
the deployment in the course.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the faculty signs the contract that includes the guidelines for the
course, the team of students will begin to work through the development
of the DS Module together.</p>
<p>Pedagogical and Curricular Strategies</p>
<p>deleted.</p>
<p>Key Diversity and Inclusion Practices and Strategies</p>
<p>The Division’s student teams recruit from disciplines all across campus
to give undergraduates opportunities to lead, form connections, and
shape the Berkeley data science community. Teams take on projects in the
curriculum, internal operations, analytics, and more. Team structure
changes semester to semester based on where students see opportunities
for the Division to grow. A holistic, codified application review
process helps teams prioritize potential members with a passion for the
field and a belief in a growth mindset in relation to technical skills
and experience.</p>

<p>Program Description</p>
<p>Applied content in data science is made available by the work of the
Jupyter Notebook Development Teams. They work in small groups on
JupyterHub to stay thoughtfully involved in the ongoing process of
applied data science lessons for entry level data scientists. Neer-peer
learning allows students to move through apprenticeship level
responsibilities as they move from novice (first tier) experiences into
the lead of Team Lead (second tier). The student team members create
course content gaining a sense of community, collaboration skills, and
professionalization imbued in a growth mindset structure as they provide
difficult content into accessible chunks.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stage 1 (Before the start of the semester): The contract is written</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>and a meeting is held by the domain-specific DS Modules Program
Coordinator, the Data Science Undergraduate Studies Curriculum
Coordinator, any Graduate Student Instructors, and the faculty.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Stage 2 (First week of the semester): Domain-specific DS Modules</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Program Coordinator sends interest forms to the developers.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Stage 3 (Middle of the semester): The domain-specific DS Modules</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Program Coordinator connects the faculty and student team members
over email. This email includes guidelines regarding the minimum
necessary requirements of collaboration for the Jupyter Notebook
development. The faculty is made aware that they should expect an
email weekly, be prepared to review the first version, and review
the final Jupyter Notebook.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Stage 4: The Team Lead becomes the coordinator of communication with</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>the development team and the faculty. The Team Lead also stays in
close contact with the domain-pecific DS Modules Program
Coordinator.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>If the Development Team Lead does not receive a response to an</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>initial and a follow-up reminder email, they will contact the
Program Coordinator. The Program Coordinator will then reach
out.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>The faculty needs the capacity to be able to answer questions</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>about the set deployment date of the domain-specific DS Module
weeks in advance as the Jupyter Notebook is developed. Timely
feedback and requests for changes need to be sent early so
that students have the time in their course and schoolwork
schedule to make the updates.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional Guidance for Implementation</p>
<p>A critical factor in moving this program from university to university
is the infrastructure. UC Berkeley builds a data science program that
uses existing campus resources, a specific group of staff, and
agreed-upon guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is an assumption that all students have access to a laptop or</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Chrome book because the library has a lending program.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>The program currently uses the previously existing Data Hub and data</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>puller.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>UC Berkeley’s program has an instructional designer with some data</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>science teaching experience. Having someone who devotes their full
time and has a knowledge of teaching foundational data science is
a crucial component of the Jupyter Notebook Development Teams.
Many of the faculty would like to add data science content into
their courses through DS Modules and work with the development
teams but do not know how to begin. Having staff with this
experience provides someone with background work in seeking and
preparing an appropriate data set and assisting in the translation
of the learning experience for the Development Team.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>UC Berkeley’s program has specific foundational criteria for their</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>data sets. It must be appropriate content licensed for their use
and that students can work efficiently. Again, if the faculty does
not have a background in data science, this might be an impossible
feat independently.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendations</p>
<p>Finally, one idea for the program that is not yet deployed is the
creation and repetition of DS Module development using templates. A set
of DS Module templates would include domain agnostic templates for
linear regression, cleaning data, hypothesis testing, and other familiar
topics. The Jupyter Notebook Development Teams would build specific DS
Modules using the models. They may be more formulaic than the current
process at UC Berkeley, but it could make the management of DS Module
development simpler.</p>

<p>Data Peer Consulting</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>Data Peer Consulting is a program that supports data science work across
campus. The Data Peer Consultants offer meetings with students,
post-docs, visiting scholars, and faculty regarding any questions about
a data science project. Currently, they primarily serve undergraduate
students. There is also a smaller population of Master’s-level and Ph.D.
students using their service. They also assist students from
undergraduate and graduate-level courses that include a DS Module.</p>
<p>Data Peer Consulting is a program available to the campus population
throughout the academic year with an online calendar that displays both
the scheduled drop-in times and the peer consultant, along with the
designated location on the third floor of the undergraduate library or
the online meeting Zoom Link. This project began in Fall 2017 as a
collaboration between the <a class="reference external" href="http://stories.lib.berkeley.edu/ccl/">[Center for Connected Learning]{.underline}
(the learning floor of spaces in the student library to support varying
sensory needs and forms of hands-on
learning)</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://dlab.berkeley.edu/">[D-Lab]{.underline}</a>, and the Division of
Computing, Data Science, and Society. Currently, a total of sixteen
students are involved in the program. Two of these students serve as
<em>Data Peer Consulting Leads</em> who oversee student meetings and
communication. The team lead directly connects with both the program
analyst for the UC Berkeley Data Science Undergraduate Studies and the
program coordinator as they supervise their peers. All consultants work
three hours a week in pairs.</p>
<p>The physical Data Peer Counseling station is set up in the library
corner as a table with two individuals within a roped-off area that is
perpendicular to the Data Science Peer Advising table. They have clear
signage and laptops with them. This resource offers face-to-face
meetings between 11am to 4pm Monday through Friday during the academic
year. Students can also contact them through their program email to ask
about scheduling other appointment times. A consultation typically lasts
from fifteen to thirty minutes. Hour-long consultation may occur but are
not typical.</p>
<p>Target Audience</p>
<p>Because the Data Peer Consulting is physically located in a public
library space, it can reach the broader campus community of students.
The sixteen data peers are undergraduate students that list their
coursework online so that other undergraduate students can best match
their needs to the data peer. Two Data Peers commented that their
primary audience is students who are not majoring in data science. The
Data Peer Consulting program aims to support students from a wide range
of domains who have data science questions.</p>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>Overall, the primary goal of Data Peers is to support students’ data
science work across campus. Data Peers is a drop-in support network for
undergraduate, graduate, and faculty using data sciences in their
research. This program allows for further assistance in data science for
students from diverse domains who may be using data science in their
coursework but do not yet understand the methodological framework.</p>
<p>This program offers a pathway to leadership in data science
consultation. Students begin with specific coursework, then have the
opportunity to work closely with the campus community. Students have
hands-on experience that can build students’ resumes, offer course
credit, and then a paid position through increased leadership.</p>
<p>Pedagogical and Curricular Strategies</p>
<p>The conceptual framework for this program includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Near Peer Learning</p></li>
<li><p>Self-directed learning</p></li>
<li><p>Crossover learning (the library as an informal space),</p></li>
<li><p>Distributed Learning Environments (practice across time and physical</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>areas, see Roediger III &amp; Pyc, 2012)</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of their training, the Data Peer student consultants all enroll
in a pedagogical course, DATA-198 (a curriculum developed from combining
multiple student-led DeCal courses that the students offered
simultaneously covering similar material), that the <em>DS Modules Program
Coordinator</em> teaches. The students are instructed broadly on education
including the importance of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and a specific
session on critical education. Students gain hands-on work experience in
the consultations.</p>
<p>There are two components to this course: the workshop and the
application. Workshops aim to be thought-provoking and relevant.
Students assess the value of workshop content afterward to improve
future iterations. It is planned to be 7 to 8 weeks of curriculum. The
course has a standard pedagogy and focuses on learning outcomes. The
work is data science-specific including tips and tricks for Jupyter
Notebooks, recommended Python libraries, and content on ethics.
Discussions include challenges and opportunities in having open-ended
conversations about data and how students can respond to them during
consultations.</p>
<p>The program uses a Slack Channel to communicate about common questions
when they need assistance from other Data Peers. The students
participate as part of the course the first year and receive pay for
subsequent semesters.</p>
<p>Key Diversity and Inclusion Practices and Strategies</p>
<p>As part of the DATA-198 course, students learn about stereotype threat,
imposter syndrome, and tone of setting their learning environment. Many
students express their desire to become involved because they want to
join the existing community space of the Division of Computing, Data
Science, and Society.</p>
<p>Cyber Resources</p>
<p>Students collect records regarding consultations as people drop-in. The
service user fills out a form online. Consultees enter their names,
department, the time, the kind of question they need assistance with,
and other similar consultation demographics.</p>

<p>Program Description</p>
<p>The Data Peer Consulting program provides students and faculty across
campus assistance with data science work through a drop-in table at the
undergraduate student library. Data Peers all take a foundational course
that transitions them into developing consultation and teaching skills.
During the course session, they work as a data consultant and are
eligible to receive compensation in subsequent semesters. All of the
consultants connect through a Slack channel where they can share
questions and answers about consultation sessions.</p>
<p>Individuals can also request a time outside of the drop-in sessions for
a consultation. Consultations generally last from fifteen minutes to one
hour. This service does not cover material of substantial depth but
assists in getting people “unstuck” in their data science work. Data
Peer Consulting is one of the many opportunities in data science
programming at UC Berkeley where students can gain hands-on skills using
and trouble-shooting data science issues on campus. They had about 100
help requests last year.</p>
<p>Best Practices for Variation Across Institutions</p>
<p>Other institutions need to think critically about how to train the data
peers (the use of DATA-198 materials). They can ensure the compatibility
of the training material content by updating them to fit their student
audience best.</p>
<p>Other institutions should be aware of the specific gaps that this
program can fill for their institution. Building a working relationship
with departments, data science courses, and faculty is important.
Relationships with faculty allow for a smoother connection as the
institution uses the program as a broad resource.</p>
<p>Data Scholars Foundations Seminar</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>The Data Scholars Foundation seminar is a one-unit seminar for students
in the Data Scholars program who are enrolled concurrently in the
Foundations of Data Science course. This seminar meets for one hour,
once per week. Students attend the class and engage with other student
scholars, program staff, and the student instructor weekly. The course
is a blend of instructional support for Data 8, guidance on navigating
the data science ecosystem at Cal, a series of guest speakers, and
workshops.</p>
<p>Target Audience</p>
<p>The Foundations Seminar is the first of the courses of the Data Scholars
series. Students enroll while they enroll in the Foundations Course. The
Foundations Seminar directly engages with the Foundations coursework,
and Data Scholars are put into a lab or multiple lab sections together.
The grouping of students in the lab creates a smaller community for Data
Scholars to refine their understandings within the seminar.</p>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>Within this seminar, students will engage in topics of diversity in the
field of Data Science and its unique challenges. The seminar explores
various applications of Data Science and career possibilities. This
allows the student to gain an understanding of the resources and
opportunities available to them. Finally, students receive adequate
support, mentorship, and tutoring to perform successfully in the
Foundations Course.</p>
<p>Key Pedagogical or Curricular Strategies</p>

underrepresented students to data science, what you can do with a career
in data science, data science opportunities at Cal, and practice
problems.</p>
<p>As a small group, the students also discuss developing their resume,
reviewing Foundations in Data Science Course topics, and attend
workshops on web scraping, R, and other data science topics.</p>

<p>Program Description</p>
<p>The Foundations Seminar is a one-unit course that supports Data Scholars
in their successful completion of the Foundations course and prepares
them for the two other seminars in this series. Through a blend of
targeted small group support and integration into a smaller data science
community, these students can develop their data science literacy and
network. The Data Scholars program supports URM students in their entry
to data science at Cal and prepares them to use specific tools through
workshops. This first seminar of the three-seminar series is a platform
for further work in the Data Scholars Pathways and Data Scholars
Discovery Research projects that follow.</p>
<p>Best Practices for Variation Across Institutions</p>
<p>It is essential to be mindful of the specific student body and needs of
students on your campus. The focus of the Foundations seminar is to
closely support students who may go underserved in their data science
work. For other institutions, this could be developed with the main
focus that highlights one area: the development of a small cohort,
beginning a research project, peer-to-peer work, or workshops.</p>

<p>Data Science Discovery Projects</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>The Data Science Discovery Program connects undergraduates with
hands-on, team-based opportunities to contribute to data research
projects. Undergraduates collaborate with graduate and postdoctoral
students, collaborative research institutions, inventive projects, and
educational initiatives across UC Berkeley. The students’ work in the
Discovery Projects earns them <a class="reference external" href="https://urap.berkeley.edu/">[Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship
Program (URAP)]{.underline}</a> credits towards
their degree. The URAP program involves Berkeley undergraduates deeply
within the university’s research life through direct connection with
mentors. The undergraduate students experience first-hand what it means
to be part of an intellectual community engaged in research.</p>
<p>Data science is an intrinsically interdisciplinary process with broad
reach, fast-scaling capacity, and a large pool of interested students
and projects. The Data Science Discovery Program, a joint effort of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/">[Berkeley Institute for Data
Sciences]{.underline}</a>, Division of
Computing, Data Science, and Society, and the [<a class="reference external" href="http://urap.berkeley.edu/">Undergraduate Research
Apprenticeship Program (URAP</a>)]{.underline},
was created in 2015. The program was developed to offer undergraduates
the opportunity to build and apply data science skills and at the same
time to provide collaborators with skilled students to help address
their data challenges.</p>
<p>Target Audience</p>
<p>The Data Science Discovery Experiences model seeks to identify, connect,
and scale access for undergraduate students, usually in their 3rd
semester or beyond, in the data science space. It does so by creating a
sustainable and diverse pipeline of projects by improving the matching
and database system, fine-tuning the training and consulting services
needed by graduate students, postdocs, and undergraduate research leads,
and expanding internal and public communication.</p>
<p>Research Partner Organizations (both in the Berkeley community and in
the broader community), faculty, and graduate students can all assist in
making research accessible to students. Social Impact efforts with
non-profit community groups offer the opportunity to help address
critical community issues.</p>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>This program provides hands-on data science training and research
experience for undergraduate students, irrespective of major while
allowing students to earn academic credit in the process.</p>
<p>The discovery projects build connections via data science between campus
stakeholders/units and research partnerships with community social
impact organizations.</p>
<p>Key Pedagogical or Curricular Strategies</p>
<p>This program uses active co-construction of cooperative learning (Chiu &amp;
Linn 2011; Linn, 1995, 2000) by allowing students to work on genuine
projects relevant to the “real world.” Graduate students supervise
undergraduates in near-peer teaching, as students work in small groups
(~5) of other students. The flexibility that arises from students being
matched with projects based on their interests then enhances the
opportunity for students for their professional network.</p>
<p>Key Diversity and Inclusion Practices and Strategies</p>
<p>The Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society—of which the Data
Science Discovery Projects program is a part—is committed to making
Data Science inviting, engaging, and respectful for people of diverse
identities, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. In our vision,
equity and inclusion are essential elements of educating a rising
generation of students, building a collaborative presence across campus,
and serving society. Data Science raises fundamental issues of justice
and participation in how it engages with human beings as sources of
data, as analysts, and as people affected by its products. In everything
the Division does, we are invested in working with our partners to shape
this new field to be equitable and inclusive.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/research/discovery">[Data Science Discovery
Projects]{.underline}</a>
create opportunities for students to experience sustained teamwork on
projects with high potential for collaborative impact. Diverse teams of
students with different backgrounds, interests, and levels of experience
are supported in working together. Collaboratives explicitly foster
students’ work on long-term projects oriented toward societal impact.</p>
<p>The Division’s student teams recruit from disciplines all across campus
to give undergraduates opportunities to lead, form connections, and
shape the Berkeley Data Science community. Teams take on projects in the
curriculum, internal operations, analytics, and more. Team structure
changes semester to semester based on where students see opportunities
for the Division to grow. A holistic, codified application review
process helps teams prioritize potential members with a passion for the
field and a belief in a growth mindset over pure technical skills and
experience.</p>

<p>Narrative regarding links between Component Goals, Pedagogical
Strategies, and Central Elements of the Program</p>
<p>This program’s goals are accomplished by matching students (based on the
research interests indicated in their applications) with project needs.
They work closely in small teams to develop collaboration skills and
applied knowledge. Being a part of a Discovery Project team brings
students into direct contact with organizations that require assistance
with data science problems.</p>

<p>Best Practices for Variation Across Institutions</p>
<p>Currently, at Berkeley, ~ 30% of the interested 300–400 students are
matched with projects. Important factors to consider include (a) a
robust database (with an underlying matching algorithm), (b) having
staff to aid with the matching process, and (c) partner outreach.</p>
<p>Other Implementation Notes</p>
<p>For partners, there are a few requests that they consider: (a) the level
of support your project needs, and (b) the level of support/mentorship
you can provide.</p>

<p>Data Scholars Pathways Seminar</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>This course is one of the three sequence seminars for students in the
Data Scholars program. After finishing the Foundations Course, students
take the Pathways Seminar. This course exposes Data Scholars to
opportunities specific to future employment in data science. The Seminar
attracts a broad range of students, such as people curious to know more
about data science outside of the Foundations Course to students who
know they want to major and work in the field.</p>
<p>Target Audience</p>
<p>The Data Science Pathways Seminar is one part of the Data Scholars
Program. Data Scholars take it after they have completed the Foundations
Course and the Foundations Seminar for the Data Scholars Program. The
course offers a deeper understanding of future employment opportunities
for students interested in pursuing data science.</p>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>The Pathways Seminar focuses on five goals.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Understand multidisciplinary career opportunities within data</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>science.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Build an understanding of essential data science tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Network with cohort, speakers, mentors, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Envision long-term research/internship efforts &amp; build portfolio.</p></li>
<li><p>Boost confidence in a planned/flexible format.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Key Pedagogical or Curricular Strategies</p>
<p>In Pathways, students learn about the opportunities of real-world data
science applications through three main avenues. First, guest speakers
from industry, research, and academia talk with students on what they do
with data science, how they got there, and advice for undergrads.
Secondly, workshops led by the instructor, D-Lab staff, and guest
speakers give students valuable professional and technical skills to
secure relevant internships and research positions. Finally, self-guided
exploration and reflection assignments will empower students to gain
desired skills and connections in data science subfields of personal
interest.</p>
<p>The instructor encourages a welcoming course by setting group
expectations. Examples of these expectations include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“It’s okay not to know.” This guiding principle acknowledges the</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>acceptance and importance of questions at any time.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>“Growth mindset.” Specifically, in data science, abilities can be</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>developed through dedication and hard work across time instead of
a “fixed mindset,” assuming that you’re either good at data
science or not.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>“Everyone has something to offer in the discussion.” All of us have</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>interacted with and been affected by “Big Data.” Everyone in the
seminar brings valuable questions, opinions, and insights,
regardless of their technical experience or conceptual knowledge.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>“Step up/step back.” Discussion is more vibrant when you both add</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>your unique point of view (“step-up”) AND “step back” if you’ve
been sharing a lot recently (or if you’re having a bad day).</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>“Don’t yuck my yum.” No negative comments are welcome regarding</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>someone else’s preferred workflow/tools/language/etc. (e.g., Mac
vs. PC, Python vs. R, tabs vs. spaces). We will respect everyone’s
preferences.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Key Diversity and Inclusion Practices and Strategies:</p>
<p>Students are empowered to participate and process the information
together throughout the semester. Students think through their
understanding of employment pathways by writing start and exit
reflections (1-page write-ups of your thoughts and questions on a career
in data science, submitted in the first and last weeks of the semester).</p>
<p>Weekly workshops and speaker background assignments create a foundation
for students to explore background articles, videos, and or coding
assignments that will provide a foundation for speakers and workshops.
Students are expected to submit two points that stood out to them from
the background and two questions they have for the speaker/workshop to
receive credit.</p>

<p>Program Description</p>
<p>The Pathways Seminar is one part of a three-course series to support
Data Scholars’ success at Cal. This seminar meets for one-and-a-half
hours, once per week. During this course, students attend talks from
speakers and workshops on data science tools. The small seminar space
has a foundation of valuing student support needs and enhancing their
ability to network with faculty and professionals.</p>
<p>Best Practices for Variation Across Institutions</p>
<p>It is useful to develop a network of guest speakers and community
partners who can host workshops. Your focus areas for speakers and
workshops will vary depending on your student population and needs. For
example, at Cal in Spring 2018, a guest speaker from the College Futures
Foundation came to the Pathways Seminar.</p>

<p>Foundations of Data Science Course</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>Foundations of Data Science (Data 8) is an introductory data science
course that combines principles and skills in statistics, programming,
inference, modeling, hypothesis testing, visualization, and exploration.
It provides a foundation in the many fields encompassed within data
science and gives students a practical introduction to the technical
field. There may be several hundred students registered for Data 8
during any given semester. Undergraduate student instructors are
employed to lead class discussion sections as well as grading for large
classes. These students also serve as peer instructors to lower-division
undergraduates taking the course. The course should be taken
concurrently with a connector course. Some students might also be
eligible to join Data Scholars if they are from marginalized groups.</p>
<p>Target Audience</p>
<p>First-year students interested in data science, undergraduates with no
prior experience with data science, python, or advanced math and
statistics, and students who want to explore STEM careers take the
Foundations Course for an introduction to the process of analyzing data.</p>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>This course introduces students to programming so that they can
comfortably carry out computational data science techniques. Ethical
implications and biases are heavily addressed while introducing machine
learning, using real-world examples in lectures, labs, and homework.</p>
<p>Linking domain knowledge to data science as students learn coding and
statistics is a key goal of the course. Students receive support from
upper-classmen, near-peers who have roles as Undergraduate Student
Instructors.</p>
<p>Developing science capital and identity involves introducing data
science without prerequisite courses in advanced mathematics,
statistics, or computer science.</p>
<p>The Foundations Course provides a personal experience for over 1,500
students each semester. To achieve this feat, the Foundations Course has
forty-five teaching assistants (TAs),approximately six of whom are Head
TAs who organize the system of teaching assistant support. Additionally,
150 academic interns …</p>
<p>As the slide below describes, tasks such as grading, staff meetings, and
prep hours allow the instructional team to collaborate and teach the
Foundations Coursethrough a weekly schedule across the semester.</p>

<p>Key Pedagogical or Curricular Strategies</p>
<p>At its core, the course lowers the level of abstraction by using
domain-related questions while teaching Python coding and statistical
methods. Near-peer teaching takes place by undergraduate student
instructors who have taken the course before and have some level of
pedagogical training. A built-in grader for immediate feedback
facilitates active learning while the student is completing assignments.</p>
<p>While the Foundations Course acknowledges the broader field, this course
is designed to focus only on the computation skills that students need
in order to work with data. For example, the necessary prerequisites for
a Computer Science Course 1 include “Read and write compound expressions
that involve variables and multiple data types.” The Foundations Course
focuses on core strategies to prepare students for more complex work,
such as working with methods to visualize the data with tables and
arrays, as well as learning the differences between names and strings
while avoiding unnecessary language syntax and semantics.</p>
<p>The goal is to write code that can do something interesting without
learning about all kinds of compound expressions. The Foundations Course
does teach the importance of syntax and programming languages in writing
down computational simulations.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Visualize then qualify.</p></li>
<li><p>Teach with real data whenever possible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Key Diversity and Inclusion Practices and Strategies</p>
<p>The Foundations Course is designed to be inclusive of all students.
Inclusion is built through the belief that all students’ lives and
educational experiences can be enriched through data literacy.</p>
<p>This course—and all of the other UCB Data Science Educational Program
courses—are built with open-access infrastructure and tools.</p>
<p>Jupyter Notebooks are easily accessible for students with little data or
statistical knowledge. This provides students with both a low barrier to
entry and the basis to develop a positive data science identity.</p>

<p>Other Key Inputs</p>
<p>Smaller lab sections for two hours with Undergraduate Instructors and
Instructor Office Hours are available. They require signing up but are
available every day of the week. The frequency of office hours and the
lab requirements are meant to offset the large lecture setting.</p>
<p>Those in Data 8 are encouraged to take Connector courses during the same
semester in order to leverage the amount of time spent practicing coding
and learning domain-specific theory. Students from marginalized groups
can also join Data Scholars concurrently to enhance their exposure to
data science mentors and career paths.</p>
<p>Narrative regarding links between Component Goals, Pedagogical
Strategies, and Central Elements of the Program</p>
<p><em>Foundations of Data Science</em> combines three perspectives: inferential
thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data
arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data
so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical
concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference,
in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including
economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social
networks. It delves into social issues surrounding data analysis, such
as privacy and design.</p>
<p>Best Practices for Success/Variation Across Institutions</p>
<p>Institutions using different course management systems may need to
adjust some of the cyberinfrastructures. The digital infrastructure of
the course must be set up and tested before the course begins. Setting
up a Jupyterhub can vary depending on the planned course size.
Additionally, having an automatic grader is essential for large class
sizes.</p>
<p>Two components of the program that require additional resources for
near-peer teaching are Data Peers consulting and Undergraduate Student
Instructors. The creation of Connector Courses and DS Modules will also
require networking and collaboration with other campus departments.</p>
<p>Critical TA Professional Development and Training</p>

<p>Undergraduate Student Instructors</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>Undergraduate Student Instructors (UGSIs) provide teaching services to
support UC Berkeley’s rapidly growing data science program. Working
alongside instructors, UGSIs are part of the scalable peer instruction
model of the undergraduate curriculum. The UGSIs help facilitate
collaborative team-based learning, near-peer instruction, and active
learning. UGSIs are highly-motivated to learn and to share their
knowledge. This model is a cost-effective resource that supports
peer-learning, provides mentoring, and iteratively enables the
co-creation of course materials alongside the professor.</p>
<p>Employing undergraduate students as instructors is a unique and
successful aspect of the program, and has helped the expansion of the
Data Science Undergraduate Studies over the past five years. On
occasion, departments within the College of Letters &amp; Science may have a
shortage of applicants for Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) positions.
If no qualified graduate student from the appointing department or other
departments is available, a highly motivated and advanced undergraduate
may work in the GSI position. In this program, UGSIs must have previous
knowledge of the subject and complete domain-specific courses on
teaching Data Science.</p>
<p>Target Audience</p>
<p>The target audience for the UGSI positions are undergraduate students
who have taken and excelled at the course for which they apply. This
includes students interested in skill development, leadership, and
education. In general, students are seldom able or allowed to become
UGIs until their second year at Cal. They often stay multiple semesters
and may choose to continue teaching a particular course with a specific
instructor.</p>
<p>Students may become a UGSI for one of two main reasons, reflecting the
two different types of employment available with the UGSI position.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Undergraduates in the 8-hour position are often in direct contact</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>with students because their work responsibilities include teaching
student discussion sections directly, holding communal office
hours, answering questions on Piazza, and prepping for their
classes.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Undergraduates in the 20-hour position may take on specialized</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>leadership or logistical roles, including “Head TA” and “Head of
Logistics.” These UGSIs are offered fee remission, and for this
reason, attract more students who are from out of state and/or
interested in staying for multiple semesters.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both UGSIs and instructors hold office hours. Moreover, there are
different types of study sessions such as “Homework Parties” and
“Midterm Reviews” that are run nearly entirely by student staff. Student
staff often prepare study aids for the students for these sessions, such
as worksheets and review sheets of practice problems for students to
work on. Additionally, there are “Tutors,” another category of
undergraduate student course support who help out at office hours or
study sessions and are not paid. Students who begin as Tutors and
perform well for a semester or more have a better chance of obtaining
the UGSI job. There are a similarly large number of Tutors as there are
UGSIs.</p>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>Undergraduate student instructors provide a more personalized and
refreshing experience for the students in data science courses. UGSIs
are able to relate and provide both professional and personal support to
students, often in a different way than GSIs and professors. First,
UGSIs have current knowledge of the course requirements and expectations
and are fully familiar with the course from a dual perspective of both a
student and teacher. Second, UGSIs can share the methods they have
already developed and honed to work through the course material. Third,
UGSIs remember their experience with the material for the first time and
are able to guide other students through the course, easily identifying
roadblocks to learning material as well as providing explanations
helpful to a student encountering the course for the first time. Fourth,
some students feel less intimidated and more comfortable asking for help
from a peer instructor rather than from a GSI or professor.</p>
<p>Becoming a UGSI is a path available to students who wish to pursue a
career in education or academia.</p>
<p>Key Pedagogical or Curricular Strategies</p>
<p>The [<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sequoia-tree/teaching-cs/commit/6ce5e1b85a9006584b7baa9a2ca4567a185d4416">course

from Introduction to Teaching Computer Science includes written
reflection as a way that UGSIs can process and think about how to apply
concepts to their teaching.</p>

height=”3.4027777777777777in”}</p>
<p>Links to Key Cyber Resources and their Implementation</p>
<p>Notable key instructional support resources include Piazza and
Gradescope. For many assignments the autograder OkPy is used. OkPy
requires an assignment to be completed on datahub, then the data hub
submits to OkPy and can be viewed in submission format, and there is a
script to take the submission on Ok Py and export it to Gradescope. Many
courses in the data science department have an online textbook that is
kept up to date, which is useful for linking chapters in slideshows.
Data 100 has a separate data hub through which students can fetch and
submit their assignments through datahub, which includes all the
packages and dependencies so all students are working under the same
environment.</p>
<p>Coursework involves both coding and written components. These usually
entail creating a visualization and interpreting it. Subsequently OkPy
autogrades the coding and Gradescope grades the written portion.</p>

<p>Candidates for data science courses (which are cross-listed as stats
courses) must also:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Be enrolled in no fewer than 12 units of course work</p></li>
<li><p>Have an overall GPA of 3.1 or higher</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The narrative regarding links between Component Goals, Pedagogical
Strategies, and Central Elements of the Program</p>
<p>The construction of the course is a combination of the professor aided
by the UGSIs. There is a pedagogy team for some of the larger courses.</p>
<p>Best Practices for Variation Across Institutions</p>
<p>The most important aspects of the program are the branched hierarchy of
student staff that carries out delegation through a chain of command and
the incremental improvements the course material receives over the
years.</p>
<p>Critical TA Professional Development and Training</p>
<p>Within the Data Science program, there are several steps required for
training. To become a UGSI, students must take CS 370: Introduction to
Teaching Computer Science. This course covers methods for teaching,
including leading one-on-one practice tutoring. UGSIs often have weekly
meetings throughout the semester to go over material and announcements.</p>
<p>Implementation for Specific Courses</p>
<p>Below are several popular courses that each have their own structure of
staffing depending on the age/iterations of the course, size of the
class, and professor’s wishes. Course use and growth as a function of
student-instructor support has linearly expanded to include thousands of
students, in certain typically lower-division courses.</p>

<p>Undergraduate GSIs</p>
<p>Generally, undergraduate students may not be appointed as GSRs or GSIs,
but they can be appointed as Readers or Tutors and are not eligible for
the fee remission program (please refer to Article 11 of the UC-UAW
contract). However, if a department is unable to recruit any qualified
graduate students or hire a lecturer to fill an essential GSI position,
the department may submit a written request of exception to the Graduate
Division. In such cases exceptions are allowed for undergraduate GSI
appointees but under NO circumstances can undergraduate students be
appointed as GSRs.</p>
<p>The Dean of the Graduate Division has delegated authority to the deans
of the College of Letters and Science and the College of Engineering to
approve undergraduate GSIs.</p>
<p>If the department or hiring unit is not in College of Letters &amp; Science
or College of Engineering, please complete the Request to Appoint
Undergraduates as GSIs Form (XLS) and provide an explanation of why
undergraduates must be hired to gradappt&#64;berkeley.edu.</p>
<p>Requirements for Undergraduate GSIs:</p>

request.)</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Adhere to the same criteria of eligibility required for graduate</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>student GSIs. If the undergraduate appointee does not speak
English as a native language, they must pass the English
Proficiency requirement before they can teach (please refer to the
GSI Teaching &amp; Resource Center for more information).
Departments/hiring units are responsible for making sure the
student has passed the English Proficiency requirements prior to
requesting approval for the UGSI appointment. Please contact
langpro&#64;berkeley.edu with questions about a student’s English
language proficiency eligibility.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>

information.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional Guidance for Implementation</p>
<p>It must be noted that the current UGSI staffing model may undergo
changes starting 2021 because of a multi-million dollar lawsuit settled
in January 2020 between the student workers union and the institution
regarding scheduling hours and tuition remission.</p>
<p>Recommendations</p>
<p>The program may benefit from including universal design or other access
features. This may include key diversity and inclusion practices and
strategies.</p>

<p>Data Scholars Program</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>The Data Science Undergraduate Studies and D-Lab co-developed the Data
Scholars Program to respond to data science education inequity. The
program exists to address under-representation issues in the data
science community. Through the seminar series, it establishes a
welcoming, educational, and empowering group for marginalized
communities and nontraditional students. This program was launched in
Fall 2016, and it is especially suited for students who bring diverse
and positive contributions to data science. The program offers
specialized tutoring, advising, and workshops in a sequence of three
1-unit seminar courses. Students apply to join the first seminar, Data
Scholars Foundations, concurrent with the semester they enroll in the
Foundations of Data Science Course and may participate in the Data
Scholars Pathways seminar and Data Scholars Discovery seminar in
subsequent semesters.</p>
<p>Target Audience</p>
<p>Underrepresented and nontraditional students are the intended Data
Scholar program participants. The goal is to develop a strong community
and data science support for students who might not otherwise have it.
This space offers students a sense of belonging and being a part of
transformative learning while navigating challenges in courses and
deciding about a possible future in data science.</p>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>The Data Scholars program benefits students in three essential areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Support: Skill-building workshops, tutoring, and homework help are</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>available for students to gain additional peer-to-peer
collaboration and instructor assistance.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Community: Throughout the seminars, students participate in social</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>events and talks that emphasize diversity in data sciences. For
example, a data scientist or researcher may come to the Pathways
Seminar and present their work to the small group with an open
question-and-answer section so that students can actively
participate.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Mentorship: Graduate students, postdocs, faculty, staff, and alumni</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>from Cal mentor students. The program has a robust underlying
network of professionals that students can be referred to by their
instructor for specific questions and connections.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Key Pedagogical or Curricular Strategies</p>
<p>The program consists of three seminars:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data 8 Section and Foundations Seminar</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Students enrolling in Data 8 can apply to join Data Scholars.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Students will enroll in a Data Scholars-only lab section for
Data 8, and join a specialized 1-unit Foundations seminar.
Students will also have access to special office hours and
mentorship for academic support.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Data Science Pathways Seminar</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For students who have already completed Data 8 and the</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Foundations seminar, the Pathways seminar supports long-term
discovery experiences and career orientation. Pathways will
feature guest speakers from research and industry, and special
workshops for career and professional development,
portfolio-building, and goal-setting.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>This seminar will meet for 90 minutes once a week.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Data Science Discovery Seminar</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For students who have completed the Pathways seminar and have</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>two or more semesters of data science coursework completed,
the Discovery Seminar provides special workshops. The [<a class="reference external" href="https://data.berkeley.edu/research/discovery">Data
Science Discovery Research
program</a>]{.underline}
offers instruction on science tools, facilitates student
matching onto some of the ongoing research projects, and
offers research mentorship by experienced grad students and
staff.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Key Diversity and Inclusion Practices and Strategies:</p>
<p>Foundational Data Science coursework challenges students. Data Scholars
provides extra support for Underrepresented students for this
coursework. The assistance provided in the Foundations Seminar allows
students to easily ask questions and receive answers from peers and
their instructor. The increased support allows for a greater likelihood
of success in data science courses. Students can join smaller group
discussions about assumptions regarding perceptions of success, meeting
faculty, people in the private sector, and networking. The following two
seminars offer an introduction to data science careers and research.</p>

<p>Program Description</p>
<p>The Data Science Undergraduate Studies offers community to
underrepresented students and nontraditional students in data science at
Cal with the Data Scholars program. The program consists of an
application process, a Foundations Seminar to help with the Foundations
of Data Science course, a Pathways Seminar that exposes students to
avenues within data science, and the Data Scholars Discovery Projects
seminar supporting their collaborative work. The program provides
students with a welcoming and growth-mindset network of peers, mentors,
and community organizations.</p>
<p>Best Practices for Variation Across Institutions</p>
<p>Developing and supporting one or more staff roles focused on the Data
Scholars program helps with the ongoing work necessary to keep a Data
Scholars program thriving. With minimal support staff, the program
becomes restricted in specific ways, and its success can be limited.</p>
<p>Data Scholars Discovery Projects Seminar</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>The Data Scholars Discovery Projects Seminar supports Data Scholars
students participating in the Discovery Research Projects. Data Scholar
students apply to the Discovery Projects program to be matched with one
of the current research opportunities. The Data Scholar students
participate in this seminar to support their participation in the
Discovery Project program.</p>
<p>Data Scholars are provided with an additional notation of their
participation in this program to contribute to their ranking in the
interview and assignment process within Discovery Projects.</p>
<p>The Seminarwill meet for 90 minutesonce a week.</p>
